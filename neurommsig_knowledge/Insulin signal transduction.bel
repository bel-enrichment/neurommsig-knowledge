SET SupportingText = "Additional experiments were designed to investigate the presence of p35, CDK5, and p35/CDK5 kinase activity in beta-cell lines. Biochemical characterization of CDK5 kinase activity was also investigated. Among the different cell lines tested, only INS-1 cells, an insulin-producing beta-cell line, showed expression of p35 (Fig. 2A). These cells also contain protein kinase activity that can be immunoprecipitated with a p35-specific antibody (Fig. 2B). Both p35 expression and p35/CDK5 activity were absent in other cell lines, such as HeLa and NIH-3T3 (Fig. 2, A and B), although these cell lines expressed CDK5 protein (Fig. 2A). We then investigated whether the kinase activity immunoprecipitated by the p35 antibody was due to its association with CDK5. We performed experiments with roscovitine, a relatively specific inhibitor of CDK5 activity (17). The p35/CDK5 activity in INS-1 cells was inhibited by roscovitine, but not by other protein kinase inhibitors, such as H89 (protein kinase A) and SB202190 (p38MAPK; Fig. 2C). Also, the inhibition by roscovitine was dose dependent (Fig. 2D), with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 128 nm, within the range of that previously reported for CDK5 (18)."

Insulin also affected APP processing in vivo, a critical molecular step in generating Abeta, to secrete sAPP [13], [16] and [81].

Among all secreted proteases from the cells, only IDE degraded Abeta. We found that under physiological conditions IDE is secreted at high levels from the microglial cells, and degrades Abeta extracellularly [73]. Purified IDE from rat liver and brain was shown to degrade Abeta effectively. IDE is present in the soluble fractions from human brains, and binds and degrades Abeta specifically [57] and [71]. Primary cultured neurons were also shown to clear Abeta via extracellular IDE as well as IDE on the cell surface [90]. IDE from brain homogenates degrades different forms of Abeta: Abeta40, Abeta42 and an Abeta mutant in one type of AD (Dutch Variant 1-40 Q) [61] and [71]. Abeta42 is the longer form of Abeta and more abundant in the AD brain."

However, the surface and the total BACE1 were markedly increased by metformin. Through further subfractionation, using sucrose gradients, we showed that metformin treatment caused changes in the compartmentalization of APP, as evidenced by increased distribution in trans-Golgi network (TGN) vesicles (fraction 2), including those trafficks en route to early endosomes and TGN (fraction 3), and decreased distribution in membranes (fraction 5) (Fig. S1 B and C). BACE1 protein levels were found to be elevated in all 3 fractions: 2, 3, and 5, with an Ã¢â°Ë2-fold increase of the total protein. The increased distribution of both APP and BACE1 in fractions 2 and 3 are expected to favor Abeta generation within TGN and/or endocytic compartments, the two compartments with mild acidic pH optimal for BACE1 activity (33, 34). Indeed, we detected increased immunofluorescent Abeta40 signals after metformin treatment in TGN (Fig. 1E)."

We also observed a significant inhibition of metformin-stimulated Abeta production by compound C, a specific AMPK inhibitor, in a dose-dependent manner. Compound C inhibited metformin's effect by 50% when used at a concentration (20 ÃÂ¼M) that is known to guarantee its specificity for AMPK (32) (Fig. 4C).

Insulin and cortisol, a primary HPA axis hormone, are counter-regulatory, and a change in the level of either hormone influences the level of the other.[29,30] Thus, glucocorticoids can induce insulin resistance in healthy humans,[ 31,32] and hyperinsulinaemia resulting from insulin resistance can produce hypercortisolaemia. An animal study showed that rats with type 2 diabetes had higher levels of adrenocorticotrophic hormone than control individuals, consistent with chronic activation of the HPA axis.[33] In humans, plasma cortisol levels were elevated in patients with type 2 diabetes,[34] and patientswith both poorly and well controlled type 2 diabetes showed abnormal cortisol responses to hypoglycaemia.[35,36] In metabolic studies, insulin administration has been shown to increase HPA axis activity, indexed by a rise in cortisol levels"

Cohen and coworkers could show that knocking down the DAF-2 pathway in C. elegans, which is orthologous to the mammalian insulin and IGF-l signaling cascade, reduces Al31-42 toxicity [35]. Furthermore, this effect was mediated by the two downstream transcripÃÂ­ tion factors, DAF-16 and HSF-l (heat shock transcription factor-!) [132}. DAF-\6 encodes a forkhead transcription factor [133, 134], which translocates into the nucleus [135], and modulates transcription when DAF-2 signaling is abroÃÂ­ gated . The mammalian DAF-16 orthologs are Foxol, 3, and 4 [136). In the mammalian system the IR/IGF-1 R induces phosphorylation of Foxo I and triggers its translocation from the nucleus. The DAF-2 pathway reduces A ,_42 toxicity by two possible mechanisms of detoxification [35]: The first detoxification route leads to disaggregation of the toxic oliÃÂ­ gomer that is positively regulated by HSF-1 and degradation of the amyloidogenic peptides. The second mechanism mediates the formation of low toxic, high molecular weight aggregates from high toxic low molecular weight aggregates, which is positively regulated by DAF-!6. Both detoxificaÃÂ­ tion mechanisms are negatively regulated by DAF-2 signalÃÂ­ ing."

SET SupportingText = "In the first stage of this study a total of 152 SNPs were screened (Table S6). All SNPs did not significantly deviate from HardyÃ¢â¬âWeinberg equilibrium proportions in controls, 10 SNPs deviated in cases. 39 SNPs dropped out prior to analysis due to monomorphism (nÃ¢â¬â°=Ã¢â¬â°8), genotyping failure (nÃ¢â¬â°=Ã¢â¬â°21), not biallelic (nÃ¢â¬â°=Ã¢â¬â°2) and a MAFÃ¢â¬â°<Ã¢â¬â°0.05 (nÃ¢â¬â°=Ã¢â¬â°8). A total of 113 SNPs were analyzed for association with disease status in the overall sample, and 6 SNPs in 5 different genes showed significant association with disease status under at least one genetic model (Table I). Both SNPs within SOS2 were significantly associated with disease status, with the remaining positive SNPs located within RPS6KA2 (Gene ID 6196), HNF4A (Gene ID 3172), PPP1CC (Gene ID 5501), and PCK1. Additional analysis of the data stratified by APOE genotype provided evidence of association for 15 SNPs in either the APOE Îµ4 positive or APOE Îµ4 negative sample sets (Table I). Two of these SNPs were associated in the overall Stage 1 sample; SNP 139 (HNF4A) and SNP 150 (PCK1), and it was observed that these SNPs had a greater effect when stratified by APOE genotype: OR 0.5 versus 0.63; OR 2.11 versus 1.54, respectively. Two further PCK1 SNPs (SNP 144 and SNP 149) showed marginal association in the APOE Îµ4 positive samples (PÃ¢â¬â°=Ã¢â¬â°0.07, 0.09). In addition, there was evidence of positive association for both PPARgamma polymorphisms (SNP 65 and SNP 66) in the APOE Îµ4 positive sample set. Allele 2 of both of these SNPs (G and T, respectively) appeared to protect against disease (ORÃ¢â¬â°=Ã¢â¬â°0.5, ORÃ¢â¬â°=Ã¢â¬â°0.45). The result obtained with the major allele of SNP 52 within INSR (Gene ID 3643), allele A, was also suggestive of a protective factor (ORÃ¢â¬â°=Ã¢â¬â°0.5; APOE Îµ4 negative samples). A further SNP from INSR, SNP 48, showed a trend toward association, but this result was observed in the APOE Îµ4 positive samples (PÃ¢â¬â°=Ã¢â¬â°0.06). SNP 20 from the ENPP1 gene (Gene ID 5167) showed evidence for association in both the APOE Îµ4 positive and Îµ4 negative samples. A final 7 SNPs showed evidence of association in the APOE Îµ4 positive samples, SNP 34 (INPPL1 Gene ID 3636), SNP 62 (HK2 Gene ID 3099), SNP 93 (NOS3 Gene ID 4846), and in the APOE Îµ4 negative samples, SNP 72 (GC Gene ID 2638), SNP 94 (ADRB3 Gene ID 155), SNP 130 (CETP Gene ID 1071), and SNP 136 (PPP2R1A Gene ID 5518). Following correction using the False Discovery Rate Procedure (FDR) at a variety of levels, however, the majority of these results could be rejected as false discoveries (Table S8)."

SET SupportingText = "Insulin like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and insulin signaling: The underlying mechanism of neuronal survival with ABetaÂ¸ is emerging. Neuronal synapses and astrocytes of memory-processing brain regions possess insulin receptors (IRs) [99] which when activated by insulin facilitate synaptic plasticity in normal brain [100]. IR and Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) receptors consist of a-subunits and transmembrane ÃÆÃÂ¸-subunits. Binding of insulin or IGF-I to the a-subunit increases the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the ÃÆÃÂ¸-subunit, and causes autophosphorylation of the ÃÆÃÂ¸-subunit, thus triggering tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and IRS-2, as well as Shc [101] as an important pathway of cell survival. To protect against ABetaÂ¸ toxicity, the tyrosine-phosphorylated sites create binding sites for various signal-transducing molecules containing Src homology-2 domain, such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), thus activating PI3K/phosphoinostide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1)/Akt (protein kinase B)/glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3a/-3ÃÆÃÂ¸ and Ras/Raf-1/mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular-signal regulated kinase (MEK/ERK) signaling pathways [101]. In normal brain, IGF-I and insulin promote glucose utilization, energy metabolism, and neuronal survival [102], largely through PI3K/Akt/GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸ signaling [103, 104].Consistent with positive effects of insulin on synaptic plasticity [105], acute insulin treatment improved memory in rats [106] and also in normaladults and AD patients [107] by strongly activating ERK and Akt and blocking c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation in a PI3K-dependent manner [108]. The mechanism involves many steps beginning with ABetaÂ¸ activation of IGF-1/insulin receptors by locally produced IGF-1 or, possibly, ABetaÂ¸ monomers may bind to IGF-1/insulin receptors, as already shown for ABetaÂ¸ oligomers "

SET SupportingText = "The PI3K/Akt signaling: PI3K, a membrane-associated second messenger protein, and its downstream kinase, Akt, are associated with neuronal survival [111] and plasticity [112] via activation of transcription pathways and protein synthesis. PI3K pathway, which required the activation of IGF-1/insulin receptors, is the most convincing prosurvival effect of ABetaÂ¸42 monomers. The PI3K signaling pathway is important in the transmission of survival signals in many cell types including neurons [113, 114]. The PI3K-Akt signaling cascade, initiated by IRS, is phosphorylated by stimulated insulin- andIGF-receptor tyrosine kinases [115]. One of the kinases known to lie downstream of PI3K is Akt, which can be directly activated by products of PI3K [116] by promoting its phosphorylation at Ser473 and Thr308 [117]. Activated Akt, in turn, phosphorylates a wide range of substrates activating anti-apoptotic (survival) factors and inactivating pro-apoptotic factors [114, 117]. Certain proapoptotic mediators, such as the transcription factor forkhead (FOXO), the tau kinase GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸, and the Bcl2 antagonist BAD proteins, are inactivated by Akt [118, 119]. Akt downregulates the activities of GSK-3a and GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸ by phosphorylating the former at Ser21 and the latter at Ser9 [118]. Phosphorylation/inactivation of GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸, suppresses GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸-dependent phosphorylation of tau at residues overphosphorylated in AD and prevents apoptosis of confluent cells. Treatment of cortical neurons with ABetaÂ¸42 monomers increased Ser9 phosphorylation (inhibition) of the Akt substrate, GSK- 3ÃÆÃÂ¸ [97]. Inhibition of GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸ promotes cell survival through a variety of mechanisms including a reduced degradation of ÃÆÃÂ¸-catenin, which then translocates into the nucleus and activates the transcription of protective genes [126]."
