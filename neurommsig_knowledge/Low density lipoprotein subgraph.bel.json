Interestingly, Fe65 acts as a functional linker between APP and LRP (another type I membrane protein containing two NPXY endocytosis motifs) in modulating endocytic APP trafficking and ABetaÂ¸ production. A conformational change introduced by phosphorylation at Thr668 (14 amino acids proximal to the YENPTY motif) interferes with Fe65 binding to APP and facilitates BACE1 and gamma-secretase cleavage of APP. Moreover, Fe65 stabilizes the highly labile AICD, which may serve as a regulatory step in modulating the physiological function of AICD (see below). In addition to APP, Mint proteins can directly bind ADP-ribosylation factors; thus, Mint proteins can potentially regulate vesicular trafficking of APP by serving as coat proteins. Finally, the type I transmembrane protein SorLA/LR11 (a member of the VPS10p domain receptor family), which functionally interacts with cytosolic adaptors GGA and PACS-1, attenuates ABetaÂ¸ production by acting as a Golgi/TGN retention factor.

We report alterations in sphingolipid and cholesterol metabolism during normal brain aging and in the brains of AD patients that result in accumulation of long chain ceramides and cholesterol. Membrane associated oxidative stress occurs in association with the lipid alterations, and exposure of hippocampal neurons to Amyloid beta induces membrane oxidative stress and the accumulation of ceramide species and cholesterol. Treatment of neurons with alpha-tocopherol or an inhibitor of sphingomyelin synthesis prevents accumulation of ceramides and cholesterol and protects them against death induced by Amyloid beta.

Interestingly, Fe65 acts as a functional linker between APP and LRP (another type I membrane protein containing two NPXY endocytosis motifs) in modulating endocytic APP trafficking and ABetaÂ¸ production. A conformational change introduced by phosphorylation at Thr668 (14 amino acids proximal to the YENPTY motif) interferes with Fe65 binding to APP and facilitates BACE1 and gamma-secretase cleavage of APP. Moreover, Fe65 stabilizes the highly labile AICD, which may serve as a regulatory step in modulating the physiological function of AICD (see below). In addition to APP, Mint proteins can directly bind ADP-ribosylation factors; thus, Mint proteins can potentially regulate vesicular trafficking of APP by serving as coat proteins.

Deletion of LDLR caused a decrease in ABetaÂ¸ uptake, while increasing LDLR levels significantly enhanced both the uptake and clearance of ABetaÂ¸. Increasing LDLR levels also enhanced the cellular degradation of ABetaÂ¸ and facilitated the vesicular transport of ABetaÂ¸ to lysosomes. Despite the fact that LDLR regulated the uptake of apoE by astrocytes, we found that the effect of LDLR on ABetaÂ¸ uptake and clearance occurred in the absence of apoE. Finally, we provide evidence that ABetaÂ¸ can directly bind to LDLR, suggesting an interaction between LDLR and ABetaÂ¸ could be responsible for LDLR-mediated ABetaÂ¸ uptake.

Deletion of LDLR caused a decrease in ABetaÂ¸ uptake, while increasing LDLR levels significantly enhanced both the uptake and clearance of ABetaÂ¸. Increasing LDLR levels also enhanced the cellular degradation of ABetaÂ¸ and facilitated the vesicular transport of ABetaÂ¸ to lysosomes. Despite the fact that LDLR regulated the uptake of apoE by astrocytes, we found that the effect of LDLR on ABetaÂ¸ uptake and clearance occurred in the absence of apoE. Finally, we provide evidence that ABetaÂ¸ can directly bind to LDLR, suggesting an interaction between LDLR and ABetaÂ¸ could be responsible for LDLR-mediated ABetaÂ¸ uptake.

The C allele confers a 1.16 greater odds of developing late-onset AD than the T allele. AD patients have reductions in regional white matter integrity. We evaluated whether the CLU risk variant was similarly associated with lower white matter integrity in healthy young humans. Evidence of early brain differences would offer a target for intervention decades before symptom onset.  We scanned 398 healthy young adults (mean age 23.6 ÃâÃÂ± 2.2 years) with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a variation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sensitive to white matter integrity in the living brain. We assessed genetic associations using mixed model regression at each point in the brain to map the profile of these associations with white matter integrity.  Each C allele copy of the CLU variant was associated with lower fractional anisotropy (FA) - a widely accepted measure of white matter integrity- in multiple brain regions, including several known to degenerate in AD. These regions included the splenium of the corpus callosum, the fornix, cingulum, and superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi in both brain hemispheres.

Subsequently, a novel interaction between reelin and AbetaPP was discovered, leading to increase in the cell surface levels of AbetaPP and affecting AbetaPP processing and Abeta production. It was shown that reelin signaling in excitatory synapses can restore normal synaptic plasticity, which is impaired by oligomeric Abeta peptides at concentrations within the range detectable in the brains of AD patients. At high concentrations of Abeta peptides, reelin can no longer overcome the Abeta-induced functional suppression, and this condition coincides with a complete blockade of the reelin-dependent phosphorylation of NR2 subunits in NMDA receptors.

Interestingly, Fe65 acts as a functional linker between APP and LRP (another type I membrane protein containing two NPXY endocytosis motifs) in modulating endocytic APP trafficking and ABetaÂ¸ production. A conformational change introduced by phosphorylation at Thr668 (14 amino acids proximal to the YENPTY motif) interferes with Fe65 binding to APP and facilitates BACE1 and gamma-secretase cleavage of APP. Moreover, Fe65 stabilizes the highly labile AICD, which may serve as a regulatory step in modulating the physiological function of AICD (see below). In addition to APP, Mint proteins can directly bind ADP-ribosylation factors; thus, Mint proteins can potentially regulate vesicular trafficking of APP by serving as coat proteins. Finally, the type I transmembrane protein SorLA/LR11 (a member of the VPS10p domain receptor family), which functionally interacts with cytosolic adaptors GGA and PACS-1, attenuates ABetaÂ¸ production by acting as a Golgi/TGN retention factor.

In the current study, we demonstrate that modulating levels of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), a cell surface receptor that regulates the amount of apolipoprotein E (apoE) in the brain, altered both the uptake and degradation of ABetaÂ¸ by astrocytes. Deletion of LDLR caused a decrease in ABetaÂ¸ uptake, while increasing LDLR levels significantly enhanced both the uptake and clearance of ABetaÂ¸. Increasing LDLR levels also enhanced the cellular degradation of ABetaÂ¸ and facilitated the vesicular transport of ABetaÂ¸ to lysosomes. Despite the fact that LDLR regulated the uptake of apoE by astrocytes, we found that the effect of LDLR on ABetaÂ¸ uptake and clearance occurred in the absence of apoE. Finally, we provide evidence that ABetaÂ¸ can directly bind to LDLR, suggesting an interaction between LDLR and ABetaÂ¸ could be responsible for LDLR-mediated ABetaÂ¸ uptake.

A conformational change introduced by phosphorylation at Thr668 (14 amino acids proximal to the YENPTY motif) interferes with Fe65 binding to APP and facilitates BACE1 and gamma-secretase cleavage of APP. Moreover, Fe65 stabilizes the highly labile AICD, which may serve as a regulatory step in modulating the physiological function of AICD (see below). In addition to APP, Mint proteins can directly bind ADP-ribosylation factors; thus, Mint proteins can potentially regulate vesicular trafficking of APP by serving as coat proteins.

Deletion of LDLR caused a decrease in ABetaÂ¸ uptake, while increasing LDLR levels significantly enhanced both the uptake and clearance of ABetaÂ¸. Increasing LDLR levels also enhanced the cellular degradation of ABetaÂ¸ and facilitated the vesicular transport of ABetaÂ¸ to lysosomes. Despite the fact that LDLR regulated the uptake of apoE by astrocytes, we found that the effect of LDLR on ABetaÂ¸ uptake and clearance occurred in the absence of apoE.

This motif and the flanking region serve as the binding site for many cytosolic adaptors with phosphotyrosine-binding domains, including Fe65, Fe65L1, Fe65L2, Mint1 (also called X11a), Mint2, Mint3, Dab1, and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase)-interacting protein family members. Interestingly, Fe65 acts as a functional linker between APP and LRP (another type I membrane protein containing two NPXY endocytosis motifs) in modulating endocytic APP trafficking and ABetaÂ¸ production. A conformational change introduced by phosphorylation at Thr668 (14 amino acids proximal to the YENPTY motif) interferes with Fe65 binding to APP and facilitates BACE1 and gamma-secretase cleavage of APP.
