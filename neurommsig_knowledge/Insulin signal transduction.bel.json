IR and Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) receptors consist of a-subunits and transmembrane ÃÆÃÂ¸-subunits. Binding of insulin or IGF-I to the a-subunit increases the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the ÃÆÃÂ¸-subunit, and causes autophosphorylation of the ÃÆÃÂ¸-subunit, thus triggering tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and IRS-2, as well as Shc [101] as an important pathway of cell survival.

Neuronal synapses and astrocytes of memory-processing brain regions possess insulin receptors (IRs) [99] which when activated by insulin facilitate synaptic plasticity in normal brain [100]. IR and Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) receptors consist of a-subunits and transmembrane ÃÆÃÂ¸-subunits. Binding of insulin or IGF-I to the a-subunit increases the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the ÃÆÃÂ¸-subunit, and causes autophosphorylation of the ÃÆÃÂ¸-subunit, thus triggering tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and IRS-2, as well as Shc [101] as an important pathway of cell survival. To protect against ABetaÂ¸ toxicity, the tyrosine-phosphorylated sites create binding sites for various signal-transducing molecules containing Src homology-2 domain, such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), thus activating PI3K/phosphoinostide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1)/Akt (protein kinase B)/glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3a/-3ÃÆÃÂ¸ and Ras/Raf-1/mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular-signal regulated kinase (MEK/ERK) signaling pathways [101].

PI3K pathway, which required the activation of IGF-1/insulin receptors, is the most convincing prosurvival effect of ABetaÂ¸42 monomers. The PI3K signaling pathway is important in the transmission of survival signals in many cell types including neurons [113, 114]. The PI3K-Akt signaling cascade, initiated by IRS, is phosphorylated by stimulated insulin- andIGF-receptor tyrosine kinases [115]. One of the kinases known to lie downstream of PI3K is Akt, which can be directly activated by products of PI3K [116] by promoting its phosphorylation at Ser473 and Thr308 [117]. Activated Akt, in turn, phosphorylates a wide range of substrates activating anti-apoptotic (survival) factors and inactivating pro-apoptotic factors [114, 117]. Certain proapoptotic mediators, such as the transcription factor forkhead (FOXO), the tau kinase GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸, and the Bcl2 antagonist BAD proteins, are inactivated by Akt [118, 119]. Akt downregulates the activities of GSK-3a and GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸ by phosphorylating the former at Ser21 and the latter at Ser9 [118]. Phosphorylation/inactivation of GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸, suppresses GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸-dependent phosphorylation of tau at residues overphosphorylated in AD and prevents apoptosis of confluent cells. Treatment of cortical neurons with ABetaÂ¸42 monomers increased Ser9 phosphorylation (inhibition) of the Akt substrate, GSK- 3ÃÆÃÂ¸ [97]. Inhibition of GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸ promotes cell survival through a variety of mechanisms including a reduced degradation of ÃÆÃÂ¸-catenin, which then translocates into the nucleus and activates the transcription of protective genes [126].", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "reference": "20847424"}, "annotations": {"Subgraph": {"Phosphatidylinositol 3 subgraph": true, "Insulin signal transduction": true}, "Confidence": {"High": true}}, "object": {"modifier": "Activity"}, "source": 178, "target": 209, "key": "aa20aa96b2886f1615af7e341442753250f9d70ba7aa7dd58a59251c9851b17a2a541ae1c2bc6e3897d8e39d0f8d17c1446598f50acf69b3d6166cc2147035ca"}, {"line": 29472, "relation": "positiveCorrelation", "evidence": "Insulin not only regulates blood sugar concentrations but also acts as a growth factor on all cell including neurons in the central nervous system [38].

Neuronal synapses and astrocytes of memory-processing brain regions possess insulin receptors (IRs) [99] which when activated by insulin facilitate synaptic plasticity in normal brain [100]. IR and Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) receptors consist of a-subunits and transmembrane ÃÆÃÂ¸-subunits. Binding of insulin or IGF-I to the a-subunit increases the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the ÃÆÃÂ¸-subunit, and causes autophosphorylation of the ÃÆÃÂ¸-subunit, thus triggering tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and IRS-2, as well as Shc [101] as an important pathway of cell survival. To protect against ABetaÂ¸ toxicity, the tyrosine-phosphorylated sites create binding sites for various signal-transducing molecules containing Src homology-2 domain, such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), thus activating PI3K/phosphoinostide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1)/Akt (protein kinase B)/glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3a/-3ÃÆÃÂ¸ and Ras/Raf-1/mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular-signal regulated kinase (MEK/ERK) signaling pathways [101].

PI3K pathway, which required the activation of IGF-1/insulin receptors, is the most convincing prosurvival effect of ABetaÂ¸42 monomers. The PI3K signaling pathway is important in the transmission of survival signals in many cell types including neurons [113, 114]. The PI3K-Akt signaling cascade, initiated by IRS, is phosphorylated by stimulated insulin- andIGF-receptor tyrosine kinases [115]. One of the kinases known to lie downstream of PI3K is Akt, which can be directly activated by products of PI3K [116] by promoting its phosphorylation at Ser473 and Thr308 [117]. Activated Akt, in turn, phosphorylates a wide range of substrates activating anti-apoptotic (survival) factors and inactivating pro-apoptotic factors [114, 117]. Certain proapoptotic mediators, such as the transcription factor forkhead (FOXO), the tau kinase GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸, and the Bcl2 antagonist BAD proteins, are inactivated by Akt [118, 119]. Akt downregulates the activities of GSK-3a and GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸ by phosphorylating the former at Ser21 and the latter at Ser9 [118]. Phosphorylation/inactivation of GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸, suppresses GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸-dependent phosphorylation of tau at residues overphosphorylated in AD and prevents apoptosis of confluent cells. Treatment of cortical neurons with ABetaÂ¸42 monomers increased Ser9 phosphorylation (inhibition) of the Akt substrate, GSK- 3ÃÆÃÂ¸ [97]. Inhibition of GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸ promotes cell survival through a variety of mechanisms including a reduced degradation of ÃÆÃÂ¸-catenin, which then translocates into the nucleus and activates the transcription of protective genes [126].", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "reference": "20847424"}, "annotations": {"Subgraph": {"Phosphatidylinositol 3 subgraph": true, "Insulin signal transduction": true}, "Confidence": {"High": true}}, "source": 222, "target": 144, "key": "0eb293051327c1b4f0ccc53f6096c3117d446814ed863631ab9677b1702412b15036f15699f3d53647f5cfeb53de81d91ce025db69175db05f149a34666134a1"}, {"line": 43524, "relation": "association", "evidence": "Insulin like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and insulin signaling: The underlying mechanism of neuronal survival with ABetaÂ¸ is emerging.

PI3K pathway, which required the activation of IGF-1/insulin receptors, is the most convincing prosurvival effect of ABetaÂ¸42 monomers. The PI3K signaling pathway is important in the transmission of survival signals in many cell types including neurons [113, 114]. The PI3K-Akt signaling cascade, initiated by IRS, is phosphorylated by stimulated insulin- andIGF-receptor tyrosine kinases [115]. One of the kinases known to lie downstream of PI3K is Akt, which can be directly activated by products of PI3K [116] by promoting its phosphorylation at Ser473 and Thr308 [117]. Activated Akt, in turn, phosphorylates a wide range of substrates activating anti-apoptotic (survival) factors and inactivating pro-apoptotic factors [114, 117]. Certain proapoptotic mediators, such as the transcription factor forkhead (FOXO), the tau kinase GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸, and the Bcl2 antagonist BAD proteins, are inactivated by Akt [118, 119]. Akt downregulates the activities of GSK-3a and GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸ by phosphorylating the former at Ser21 and the latter at Ser9 [118]. Phosphorylation/inactivation of GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸, suppresses GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸-dependent phosphorylation of tau at residues overphosphorylated in AD and prevents apoptosis of confluent cells. Treatment of cortical neurons with ABetaÂ¸42 monomers increased Ser9 phosphorylation (inhibition) of the Akt substrate, GSK- 3ÃÆÃÂ¸ [97]. Inhibition of GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸ promotes cell survival through a variety of mechanisms including a reduced degradation of ÃÆÃÂ¸-catenin, which then translocates into the nucleus and activates the transcription of protective genes [126].", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "reference": "20847424"}, "annotations": {"Subgraph": {"Phosphatidylinositol 3 subgraph": true, "Insulin signal transduction": true}, "Confidence": {"High": true}}, "source": 227, "target": 144, "key": "f8d2c208a6bb3637842d4ef3f24783460c95924491a66fc240fea7e3a7a51a16ae20eac2b26df3e5dc9cee2d59307bff9a0289ee56bac5ff51d9e90568d8ed2c"}, {"line": 43526, "relation": "association", "evidence": "Insulin like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and insulin signaling: The underlying mechanism of neuronal survival with ABetaÂ¸ is emerging.

Furthermore, this effect was mediated by the two downstream transcripÃÂ­ tion factors, DAF-16 and HSF-l (heat shock transcription factor-!) [132}. DAF-\\6 encodes a forkhead transcription factor [133, 134], which translocates into the nucleus [135], and modulates transcription when DAF-2 signaling is abroÃÂ­ gated . The mammalian DAF-16 orthologs are Foxol, 3, and 4 [136). In the mammalian system the IR/IGF-1 R induces phosphorylation of Foxo I and triggers its translocation from the nucleus. The DAF-2 pathway reduces A ,_42 toxicity by two possible mechanisms of detoxification [35]: The first detoxification route leads to disaggregation of the toxic oliÃÂ­ gomer that is positively regulated by HSF-1 and degradation of the amyloidogenic peptides. The second mechanism mediates the formation of low toxic, high molecular weight aggregates from high toxic low molecular weight aggregates, which is positively regulated by DAF-!6.

In normal brain, IGF-I and insulin promote glucose utilization, energy metabolism, and neuronal survival [102], largely through PI3K/Akt/GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸ signaling [103, 104].Consistent with positive effects of insulin on synaptic plasticity [105], acute insulin treatment improved memory in rats [106] and also in normaladults and AD patients [107] by strongly activating ERK and Akt and blocking c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation in a PI3K-dependent manner [108]. The mechanism involves many steps beginning with ABetaÂ¸ activation of IGF-1/insulin receptors by locally produced IGF-1 or, possibly, ABetaÂ¸ monomers may bind to IGF-1/insulin receptors, as already shown for ABetaÂ¸ oligomers ", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "reference": "20847424"}, "annotations": {"Subgraph": {"Insulin signal transduction": true}, "Confidence": {"High": true}}, "source": 128, "target": 252, "key": "cb7e5f695dc1f2ee15450cdb44682e3fa5b791111ecbc60f751cda79b709f72ef3e0cb1f451486f401fe2d1b58437353325bed537d6e02820184fc5a1a266120"}, {"line": 11096, "relation": "increases", "evidence": "In SHSY5Y cells, a human neuroblastoma cell line, as well as in primary cultu res of rat cortical neurons insulin administration leads to tau hyperphosphorylation (111-113].

To protect against ABetaÂ¸ toxicity, the tyrosine-phosphorylated sites create binding sites for various signal-transducing molecules containing Src homology-2 domain, such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), thus activating PI3K/phosphoinostide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1)/Akt (protein kinase B)/glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3a/-3ÃÆÃÂ¸ and Ras/Raf-1/mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular-signal regulated kinase (MEK/ERK) signaling pathways [101]. In normal brain, IGF-I and insulin promote glucose utilization, energy metabolism, and neuronal survival [102], largely through PI3K/Akt/GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸ signaling [103, 104].Consistent with positive effects of insulin on synaptic plasticity [105], acute insulin treatment improved memory in rats [106] and also in normaladults and AD patients [107] by strongly activating ERK and Akt and blocking c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation in a PI3K-dependent manner [108]. The mechanism involves many steps beginning with ABetaÂ¸ activation of IGF-1/insulin receptors by locally produced IGF-1 or, possibly, ABetaÂ¸ monomers may bind to IGF-1/insulin receptors, as already shown for ABetaÂ¸ oligomers ", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "reference": "20847424"}, "annotations": {"Subgraph": {"Insulin signal transduction": true, "Regulation of actin cytoskeleton subgraph": true}, "Confidence": {"High": true}}, "object": {"modifier": "Activity"}, "source": 243, "target": 199, "key": "c45dd317cc8797ba28f5d4921194442ad412020e4314e45216ad5f6979be5f493335b378fed085417bec60514dd72d5facffe07702b6c769ff946988aacafd76"}, {"line": 10069, "relation": "positiveCorrelation", "evidence": "Genes such as enolase, tetanus toxin receptor, and the A2B5 antigen initially found in the nervous system were later found to be expressed in beta-cells (3).

Cohen and coworkers could show that knocking down the DAF-2 pathway in C. elegans, which is orthologous to the mammalian insulin and IGF-l signaling cascade, reduces Al31-42 toxicity [35]. Furthermore, this effect was mediated by the two downstream transcripÃÂ­ tion factors, DAF-16 and HSF-l (heat shock transcription factor-!) [132}. DAF-\\6 encodes a forkhead transcription factor [133, 134], which translocates into the nucleus [135], and modulates transcription when DAF-2 signaling is abroÃÂ­ gated . The mammalian DAF-16 orthologs are Foxol, 3, and 4 [136). In the mammalian system the IR/IGF-1 R induces phosphorylation of Foxo I and triggers its translocation from the nucleus. The DAF-2 pathway reduces A ,_42 toxicity by two possible mechanisms of detoxification [35]: The first detoxification route leads to disaggregation of the toxic oliÃÂ­ gomer that is positively regulated by HSF-1 and degradation of the amyloidogenic peptides. The second mechanism mediates the formation of low toxic, high molecular weight aggregates from high toxic low molecular weight aggregates, which is positively regulated by DAF-!6.

The mechanism involves many steps beginning with ABetaÂ¸ activation of IGF-1/insulin receptors by locally produced IGF-1 or, possibly, ABetaÂ¸ monomers may bind to IGF-1/insulin receptors, as already shown for ABetaÂ¸ oligomers ", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "reference": "20847424"}, "annotations": {"Subgraph": {"Insulin signal transduction": true, "G-protein-mediated signaling": true, "Regulation of actin cytoskeleton subgraph": true, "Nerve growth factor subgraph": true}, "Confidence": {"High": true}}, "subject": {"modifier": "Activity"}, "source": 125, "target": 73, "key": "25384e00f70cd2b8be307f5e5e54e0c0eda56b61400b80bee91d27db1d146bd4d83be6c7aa2aee67cdfd282342f3d2bcfaba93ff4365980c2040fc4efee6c782"}, {"line": 8962, "relation": "decreases", "evidence": "By way of review, insulin and IGF-1 mediate their effects by activating complex intracellular signaling pathways starting with ligand binding to cell surface receptors, followed by autophosphorylation and activation of the intrinsic receptor tyrosine kinases.34Ã¢â¬â36 Insulin/IGF-1 receptor tyrosine kinases phosphorylate IRS molecules,34,37Ã¢â¬â39 which transmit signals downstream by activating the extracellular signal-related kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) and PI3 kinase/Akt pathways, and inhibit glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta).
