During development, Notch suppresses neuronal differentiation in vivo and in vitro (Geling et al., 2004; Kabos et al., 2002). When ligands bind Notch, proteolytic cleavage of Notch receptors occurs by the gamma-secretase/nicastrin complex to release the signal-transducing Notch intracellular domain (NICD) (Yu et al., 2000). Cleaved NICDs translocate into the nucleus and interact with a nuclear protein named CBF1/Su(H)/Lag-1 (CSL) (Schroeter et al., 1998). The CSL and NICD complex activates expression of primary target genes of Notch, such as Hairy and enhancer of split (Hes) gene families (Jarriault et al., 1998). Following activation, Hes suppresses expression of transcription factors involved in neuronal differentiation, such as Mash1 and NeuroD (Pleasure et al., 2000). Notch activation is reported to strengthen glial differentiation by crosstalk to IL-6 signaling pathways, which is a known central regulator of gliogenesis. IL-6 cytokine signaling activation induces subsequent phosphorylation of gp130, Janus kinases (JAKs), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) (Kamakura et al., 2004). Upon Notch activation, increased Hes is known to facilitate complex formation between JAK2 and STAT3, promoting STAT3 phosphorylation. This facilitates accessibility of STAT3 to the DNA binding element of the GFAP promoter. In the present study, we demonstrate APP may induce glial differentiation of NPCs through activation of the Notch signaling pathway.", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "name": "Eur J Pharmacol. 2011 Jan 10;650(1):18-27.

PSs also affect different other signaling molecules, such as wingless-type MMTV integration site family (Wnt) signal transduction pathway, which is evolutionary conserved and controls many events during the embryogenesis . At cellular level, this pathway regulates morphology, proliferation, and motility of the cell. Wnt signaling pathway plays a central role during tumorigenesis, and the inappropriate activation of this pathway has been observed in several human cancers. It has been shown that Wnt-ligand-mediated signaling leads to the accumulation of cytosolic beta-catenin. Cytosolic beta-catenin will then translocate into the nucleus to bind to members of the T-cell factor (Tcf)/lymphoid-enhancing factor (Lef) family of DNA-binding proteins leading to the transcription of Wnt target genes.", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "reference": "22496686"}, "annotations": {"Subgraph": {"Gamma secretase subgraph": true, "Notch signaling subgraph": true}, "Condition": {"Normal Healthy State": true}, "Confidence": {"Medium": true}}, "source": 64, "target": 33, "key": "5f76baab92848091b03d9468a5f84a8dbde6e409719df03a0c803e752546a9d38fc0fcce212a67e18cbaf488bf166bc1cf57bcc6892c7759d1c87fb296b3a9d7"}, {"line": 2597, "relation": "association", "evidence": "Another relevant role for PSs is Notch processing.

We report a functional relationship between amyloid precursor protein and Notch1, which does not affect Delta ligand binding. First, we observed interactions between the amyloid precursor protein and Notch in mouse embryonic stem cells lacking both presenilin 1 and presenilin 2, the active proteolytic components of the gamma-secretase complex, suggesting that these two transmembrane proteins can interact in the absence of presenilin. Next, we demonstrated that the amyloid precursor protein affects Notch signaling by using Notch-dependent luciferase assays in two cell lines, the human embryonic kidney 293 and the monkey kidney, COS7. We found that the amyloid precursor protein exerts opposing effects on Notch signaling in human embryonic kidney 293 vs. COS7 cells.

During development, Notch suppresses neuronal differentiation in vivo and in vitro (Geling et al., 2004; Kabos et al., 2002). When ligands bind Notch, proteolytic cleavage of Notch receptors occurs by the gamma-secretase/nicastrin complex to release the signal-transducing Notch intracellular domain (NICD) (Yu et al., 2000). Cleaved NICDs translocate into the nucleus and interact with a nuclear protein named CBF1/Su(H)/Lag-1 (CSL) (Schroeter et al., 1998). The CSL and NICD complex activates expression of primary target genes of Notch, such as Hairy and enhancer of split (Hes) gene families (Jarriault et al., 1998). Following activation, Hes suppresses expression of transcription factors involved in neuronal differentiation, such as Mash1 and NeuroD (Pleasure et al., 2000). Notch activation is reported to strengthen glial differentiation by crosstalk to IL-6 signaling pathways, which is a known central regulator of gliogenesis. IL-6 cytokine signaling activation induces subsequent phosphorylation of gp130, Janus kinases (JAKs), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) (Kamakura et al., 2004). Upon Notch activation, increased Hes is known to facilitate complex formation between JAK2 and STAT3, promoting STAT3 phosphorylation.

During development, Notch suppresses neuronal differentiation in vivo and in vitro (Geling et al., 2004; Kabos et al., 2002). When ligands bind Notch, proteolytic cleavage of Notch receptors occurs by the gamma-secretase/nicastrin complex to release the signal-transducing Notch intracellular domain (NICD) (Yu et al., 2000). Cleaved NICDs translocate into the nucleus and interact with a nuclear protein named CBF1/Su(H)/Lag-1 (CSL) (Schroeter et al., 1998). The CSL and NICD complex activates expression of primary target genes of Notch, such as Hairy and enhancer of split (Hes) gene families (Jarriault et al., 1998). Following activation, Hes suppresses expression of transcription factors involved in neuronal differentiation, such as Mash1 and NeuroD (Pleasure et al., 2000). Notch activation is reported to strengthen glial differentiation by crosstalk to IL-6 signaling pathways, which is a known central regulator of gliogenesis. IL-6 cytokine signaling activation induces subsequent phosphorylation of gp130, Janus kinases (JAKs), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) (Kamakura et al., 2004). Upon Notch activation, increased Hes is known to facilitate complex formation between JAK2 and STAT3, promoting STAT3 phosphorylation. This facilitates accessibility of STAT3 to the DNA binding element of the GFAP promoter.

The tagged APP homodimer produced a weak fluorescent signal, while neither full-length N2, nor a truncated N2 alone, produced a visible signal, suggesting that N2 receptors do not form homodimers. The strongest fluorescent signal was obtained with co-expression of the C-terminal fragment of YFP fused to APP and the N-terminal fragment of YFP fused to the truncated form of N2.
