This newly uncovered function of beta-arrestin 2 suggests it could be targeted to decrease amyloid pathology in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Production of the amyloid-beta peptide in Alzheimer's disease by the gamma-secretase complex can be regulated by certain G protein coupled receptors. This regulation seems to be mediated by beta-arrestin-2, whose expression was found to be elevated in Alzheimer's disease brains.Recruitment of beta-arrestin 2 to a GPCR leads to interaction with the gamma-secretase complex via the Aph-1 subunit. Other members of the complex include presenilin-1 (PS-1), nicastrin (Nct) and Pen-2. The complex then moves laterally into lipid rafts, where gamma-secretase activation is enhanced. Internalization may also occur to localize gamma-secretase to late endosomes, where its activation is also increased. Cleavage of APP by beta-secretase (BACE1) to release soluble APP (sAPPb) followed by gamma-secretase produces Abeta and APP intracellular domain (AICD). Increased production and secretion of Abeta from cells can lead to extracellular Abeta aggregation in the form of plaques. Mutagenesis of GPR3 in regions of the protein that specifically interact with either G protein or beta-arrestin 2 further showed that beta-arrestin 2, not G protein, mediates the ability of GPR3 to increase Abeta levels.", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "name": "Nat Med. 2013 Jan;19(1):22-4. doi: 10.1038/nm.3053.", "reference": "23296004"}, "annotations": {"Condition": {"Normal Healthy State": true}, "Subgraph": {"Amyloidogenic subgraph": true, "G-protein-mediated signaling": true, "Gamma secretase subgraph": true}, "Confidence": {"Very High": true}}, "source": 616, "target": 389, "key": "60b107314eeb3d45115037cfbfdca1af4bd9fa5b4de40e8ccc904ee0326c9e198265361334a5d823cd3cbba53dd78d4e6901cf6dcf043a6b51ca33794a63f513"}, {"line": 384, "relation": "positiveCorrelation", "evidence": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia.

Emerging evidence demonstrates that AMPK activation is a potential target for improving perturbed brain energy metabolism that is involved in the pathogenesis of AD. The roles of AMPK in the pathogenesis of AD include Abeta-amyloid protein (Abeta) generation and tau phosphorylation. In particular, AMPK may regulate Abeta generation through modulating neuronal cholesterol and sphingomyelin levels and through regulating APP distribution in the lipid rafts. AMPK is activated by phosphorylation of Thr-172 by LKB1 complex in response to increase in the AMP/ATP ratio and by calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-beta in response to elevated Ca(2+) levels, which contributes to regulating Abeta generation. AMPK is a physiological tau kinase and can increase the phosphorylation of tau at Ser-262. AMPK can also directly phosphorylate tau at Thr-231 and Ser-396/404. Furthermore, AMPK activation decreases mTOR signaling activity to facilitate autophagy and promotes lysosomal degradation of Abeta. However, AMPK activation has non-neuroprotective property and may lead to detrimental outcomes, including Abeta generation and tau phosphorylation.

However, exceeding physiological levels of Abeta could deregulate Ca2+ signaling mechanism by excessive accumulation of Ca2+ in the cytoplasm and cytoplasmic organelles such as mitochondria. Since hippocampal neuronal calcium is one of the most potent signals in neuronal gene expression [149], Abeta-induced Ca2+ deregulation may lead to compromised synaptic function. Consistence with this hypothesis, AD has been associated with impaired cAMP signaling which may contribute to the pathophysiology of the disease. Levels of the activated (i.e. phosphorylated) form of CREB are reduced in AD compared to that of an age-matched healthy control group [164]. Calcium signaling to the cell nucleus is the key inducer of CREB phosphorylation on its activator site serine 133 [165]. Experiments in aged neurons show altered calcium signaling at the level of either calcium signal generation and/or calcium signal propagation [166].

More recent findings, however, suggest soluble Abeta oligomers may be the cause of memory loss, especially in the early stages of AD, because Abeta oligomers inhibit long-term potentiation in neurons, a well-adopted experimental paradigm for learning and memory (6, 9).

The extracellular Abeta oligomers may activate caspases through activation of cell surface death receptors. Alternatively, intracellular Abeta may contribute to pathology by facilitating tau hyper-phosphorylation, disrupting mitochondria function, and triggering calcium dysfunction.

These four genes include: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE).

Abnormal accumulation of amyloid is Amyloidosis, a term associated with diseased organs and tissues, particularly neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntingdon's. Amyloid deposits consist predominantly of amyloid fibrils, rigid, non-branching structures that form ordered assemblies, characteristically with a cross beta-sheet structure where the sheets run parallel to the direction of the fibril (Sawaya et al. 2007). Often the fibril has a left-handed twist (Nelson & Eisenberg 2006). At least 27 human proteins form amyloid fibrils (Sipe et al. 2010). Many of these proteins have non-pathological functions; the trigger that leads to abnormal aggregations differs between proteins and is not well understood but in many cases the peptides are abnormal fragments or mutant forms arising from polymorphisms, suggesting that the initial event may be aggregation of misfolded or unfolded peptides. Early studies of Amyloid-Beta assembly led to a widely accepted model that assembly was a nucleation-dependent polymerization reaction (Teplow 1998) but it is now understood to be more complex, with multiple 'off-pathway' events leading to a variety of oligomeric structures in addition to fibrils (Roychaudhuri et al. 2008). An increasing body of evidence suggests that these oligomeric forms are primarily responsible for the neurotoxic effects of Amyloid-beta (Roychaudhuri et al. 2008), alpha-synuclein (Winner et al. 2011) and tau (Dance & Strobel 2009, Meraz-Rios et al. 2010). Amyloid oligomers are believed to have a common structural motif that is independent of the protein involved and not present in fibrils (Kayed et al. 2003). Conformation dependent, aggregation specific antibodies suggest that there are 3 general classes of amyloid oligomer structures (Glabe 2009) including annular structures which may be responsible for the widely reported membrane permeabilization effect of amyloid oligomers. Toxicity of amyloid oligomers preceeds the appearance of plaques in mouse models (Ferretti et al. 2011).

Meanwhile, dysregulation or aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been widely documented in AD patients. In this study, we demonstrated that overexpression of miR-144, which was previously reported to be increased in elderly primate brains and AD patients, significantly decreased activity of the luciferase reporter containing the ADAM10 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) and suppressed the ADAM10 protein level, whereas the miR-144 inhibitor led to an increase of the luciferase activity. The negative regulation caused by miR-144 was strictly dependent on the binding of the miRNA to its recognition element in the ADAM10 3'-UTR. Moreover, we also showed that activator protein-1 regulates the transcription of miR-144 and the up-regulation of miR-144 at least partially induces the suppression of the ADAM10 protein in the presence of Abeta. In addition, we found that miR-451, a miRNA processed from a single gene locus with miR-144, is also involved in the regulation of ADAM10 expression.

Our results offer an affirmative answer, suggesting a mechanism for the abnormal production of amyloid-beta (Abeta), triggered by the slowed axonal transport at old age. We hypothesize that Abeta precursor protein (APP) is a sensor at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that detects, and signals to the nucleus, abnormalities in axonal transport. When persistently activated, due to chronically slowed-down transport, this signaling pathway leads to accumulation of Abeta within the ER. Methods and Results: We tested this hypothesis with the neuronal cell line CAD. We show that, normally, a fraction of APP is transported into neurites by recruiting kinesin-1 via the adaptor protein, Fe65. Under conditions that block kinesin-1-dependent transport, APP, Fe65 and kinesin-1 accumulate in the soma, and form a complex at the ER.This complex recruits active c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which phosphorylates APP at Thr(668). This phosphorylation increases the cleavage of APP by the amyloidogenic pathway, which generates Abeta within the ER lumen, and releases Fe65 into the cytoplasm. Part of the released Fe65 translocates into the nucleus, likely to initiate a gene transcription response to arrested transport. Prolonged arrest of kinesin-1-dependent transport could thus lead to accumulation and oligomerization of Abeta in the ER. Conclusion: These results support a model where the APP:Fe65 complex is a sensor at the ER for detecting the increased level of kinesin-1 caused by halted transport, which signals to the nucleus, while concomitantly generating an oligomerization-prone pool of Abeta in the ER. Our hypothesis could thus explain a pathogenic mechanism in AD.", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "name": "Neurodegener Dis. 2012;10(1-4):60-3.

It is believed that this region acts in an integrin-like manner and can, accordingly, be blocked by RGDS peptide sequence derived from the fibronectin-binding domain. Similarly, APP colocalizes with integrins on the surface of axons and at sites of adhesion. Evidence of interaction with laminin and collagen provides further evidence of adhesion-promoting properties. Interestingly, because the RHDS sequence is contained within the N terminus of ABetaÂ¸, similar cell adhesion-promoting properties have also been attributed to the ABetaÂ¸ peptide itself.

PI3K pathway, which required the activation of IGF-1/insulin receptors, is the most convincing prosurvival effect of ABetaÂ¸42 monomers. The PI3K signaling pathway is important in the transmission of survival signals in many cell types including neurons [113, 114]. The PI3K-Akt signaling cascade, initiated by IRS, is phosphorylated by stimulated insulin- andIGF-receptor tyrosine kinases [115]. One of the kinases known to lie downstream of PI3K is Akt, which can be directly activated by products of PI3K [116] by promoting its phosphorylation at Ser473 and Thr308 [117]. Activated Akt, in turn, phosphorylates a wide range of substrates activating anti-apoptotic (survival) factors and inactivating pro-apoptotic factors [114, 117]. Certain proapoptotic mediators, such as the transcription factor forkhead (FOXO), the tau kinase GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸, and the Bcl2 antagonist BAD proteins, are inactivated by Akt [118, 119]. Akt downregulates the activities of GSK-3a and GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸ by phosphorylating the former at Ser21 and the latter at Ser9 [118]. Phosphorylation/inactivation of GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸, suppresses GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸-dependent phosphorylation of tau at residues overphosphorylated in AD and prevents apoptosis of confluent cells. Treatment of cortical neurons with ABetaÂ¸42 monomers increased Ser9 phosphorylation (inhibition) of the Akt substrate, GSK- 3ÃÆÃÂ¸ [97]. Inhibition of GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸ promotes cell survival through a variety of mechanisms including a reduced degradation of ÃÆÃÂ¸-catenin, which then translocates into the nucleus and activates the transcription of protective genes [126].", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "reference": "20847424"}, "annotations": {"Subgraph": {"Amyloidogenic subgraph": true, "GSK3 subgraph": true}, "Confidence": {"High": true}}, "source": 366, "target": 486, "key": "270e664fc8c7751e0a51bff2cc8069656487c35760905c3a00639ba24b2e157d6acd5051e3ef7d89e6cbb7b5ba95e8a6c834bac9258f9837c570398e22f86378"}, {"line": 43926, "relation": "increases", "evidence": "Dysregulation of intracellular calcium signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AlzheimerÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢âÂ¢s disease [150].

LMP is a potentially lethal event because the ectopic presence of lysosomal proteases in the cytosol causes digestion of vital proteins and the activation of additional hydrolases including caspases. This latter process is usually mediated indirectly, through a cascade in which LMP causes the proteolytic activation of Bid (which is cleaved by the two lysosomal cathepsins B and D). The Bid activation then induces mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, resulting in cytochrome c release and apoptosome-dependent caspase activation [19].

It is well-known that axonal transport defect and attenuation of BDNF-neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase 2 (TrkB) signal are fatal to neuronal function and survival.We hypothesized that abnormal amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and Abeta production in mitochondria disturb the axonal transport by impairing mitochondrial function and attenuate BDNF-neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase 2 signal subsequently.For this hypothesis, the factors related with the initiation of AD pathology are not only limited to the neurons per se but also expanded to the microenvironment around neurons, such as the secretion of BDNF from astrocytes.

Transcriptional activation of CREB recruits a multiprotein assembly called a transcriptional co-activator complex. These often include proteins with intrinsic acetyltransferase activity. Among the best characterized transcriptional co-activator proteins is CREB binding protein (CBP). There is no direct evidence indicating how lower levels of Abeta might initiate CREB phosphorylation principally by Ca2+ signaling and/or through PKA/Atk/ERK pathways. However, exceeding physiological levels of Abeta could deregulate Ca2+ signaling mechanism by excessive accumulation of Ca2+ in the cytoplasm and cytoplasmic organelles such as mitochondria. Since hippocampal neuronal calcium is one of the most potent signals in neuronal gene expression [149], Abeta-induced Ca2+ deregulation may lead to compromised synaptic function. Consistence with this hypothesis, AD has been associated with impaired cAMP signaling which may contribute to the pathophysiology of the disease. Levels of the activated (i.e. phosphorylated) form of CREB are reduced in AD compared to that of an age-matched healthy control group [164]. Calcium signaling to the cell nucleus is the key inducer of CREB phosphorylation on its activator site serine 133 [165]. Experiments in aged neurons show altered calcium signaling at the level of either calcium signal generation and/or calcium signal propagation [166].

These often include proteins with intrinsic acetyltransferase activity. Among the best characterized transcriptional co-activator proteins is CREB binding protein (CBP). There is no direct evidence indicating how lower levels of Abeta might initiate CREB phosphorylation principally by Ca2+ signaling and/or through PKA/Atk/ERK pathways. However, exceeding physiological levels of Abeta could deregulate Ca2+ signaling mechanism by excessive accumulation of Ca2+ in the cytoplasm and cytoplasmic organelles such as mitochondria. Since hippocampal neuronal calcium is one of the most potent signals in neuronal gene expression [149], Abeta-induced Ca2+ deregulation may lead to compromised synaptic function. Consistence with this hypothesis, AD has been associated with impaired cAMP signaling which may contribute to the pathophysiology of the disease. Levels of the activated (i.e. phosphorylated) form of CREB are reduced in AD compared to that of an age-matched healthy control group [164].

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA regulators of protein synthesis that are essential for normal brain development and function. Their profiles are significantly altered in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) that is characterized by amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau deposition in brain. How deregulated miRNAs contribute to AD is not understood, as their dysfunction could be both a cause and a consequence of disease. To address this question we had previously profiled miRNAs in models of AD. This identified miR-9 and -181c as being down-regulated by Abeta in hippocampal cultures.

Our results offer an affirmative answer, suggesting a mechanism for the abnormal production of amyloid-beta (Abeta), triggered by the slowed axonal transport at old age. We hypothesize that Abeta precursor protein (APP) is a sensor at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that detects, and signals to the nucleus, abnormalities in axonal transport. When persistently activated, due to chronically slowed-down transport, this signaling pathway leads to accumulation of Abeta within the ER. Methods and Results: We tested this hypothesis with the neuronal cell line CAD. We show that, normally, a fraction of APP is transported into neurites by recruiting kinesin-1 via the adaptor protein, Fe65. Under conditions that block kinesin-1-dependent transport, APP, Fe65 and kinesin-1 accumulate in the soma, and form a complex at the ER.This complex recruits active c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which phosphorylates APP at Thr(668). This phosphorylation increases the cleavage of APP by the amyloidogenic pathway, which generates Abeta within the ER lumen, and releases Fe65 into the cytoplasm. Part of the released Fe65 translocates into the nucleus, likely to initiate a gene transcription response to arrested transport. Prolonged arrest of kinesin-1-dependent transport could thus lead to accumulation and oligomerization of Abeta in the ER. Conclusion: These results support a model where the APP:Fe65 complex is a sensor at the ER for detecting the increased level of kinesin-1 caused by halted transport, which signals to the nucleus, while concomitantly generating an oligomerization-prone pool of Abeta in the ER. Our hypothesis could thus explain a pathogenic mechanism in AD.", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "name": "Neurodegener Dis. 2012;10(1-4):60-3.

Proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein by alpha-secretase ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10) protects the brain from the production of the Abeta. Meanwhile, dysregulation or aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been widely documented in AD patients. In this study, we demonstrated that overexpression of miR-144, which was previously reported to be increased in elderly primate brains and AD patients, significantly decreased activity of the luciferase reporter containing the ADAM10 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) and suppressed the ADAM10 protein level, whereas the miR-144 inhibitor led to an increase of the luciferase activity. The negative regulation caused by miR-144 was strictly dependent on the binding of the miRNA to its recognition element in the ADAM10 3'-UTR. Moreover, we also showed that activator protein-1 regulates the transcription of miR-144 and the up-regulation of miR-144 at least partially induces the suppression of the ADAM10 protein in the presence of Abeta. In addition, we found that miR-451, a miRNA processed from a single gene locus with miR-144, is also involved in the regulation of ADAM10 expression. Taken together, our data therefore demonstrate miR-144/451 is a negative regulator of the ADAM10 protein and suggest a mechanistic role for miR-144/451 in AD pathogenesis.", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "name": "J Biol Chem. 2013 May 10;288(19):13748-61. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M112.381392.

The aim of the present study was to uncover novel potential miR-124 targets and shed light on its function in the cellular AD model. MiR-124 expression was steadily altered when its mimic and inhibitor were transfected in vitro. The results showed the expression of BACE1, one of the potential functional downstream targets of miR-124, was well correlated with cell death induced by Abeta neurotoxicity, and its expression level could be up- and down-regulated by suppression or over expression of miR-124 level respectively.

The aim of the present study was to uncover novel potential miR-124 targets and shed light on its function in the cellular AD model. MiR-124 expression was steadily altered when its mimic and inhibitor were transfected in vitro. The results showed the expression of BACE1, one of the potential functional downstream targets of miR-124, was well correlated with cell death induced by Abeta neurotoxicity, and its expression level could be up- and down-regulated by suppression or over expression of miR-124 level respectively.

However, exceeding physiological levels of Abeta could deregulate Ca2+ signaling mechanism by excessive accumulation of Ca2+ in the cytoplasm and cytoplasmic organelles such as mitochondria. Since hippocampal neuronal calcium is one of the most potent signals in neuronal gene expression [149], Abeta-induced Ca2+ deregulation may lead to compromised synaptic function. Consistence with this hypothesis, AD has been associated with impaired cAMP signaling which may contribute to the pathophysiology of the disease. Levels of the activated (i.e. phosphorylated) form of CREB are reduced in AD compared to that of an age-matched healthy control group [164].

Our results offer an affirmative answer, suggesting a mechanism for the abnormal production of amyloid-beta (Abeta), triggered by the slowed axonal transport at old age. We hypothesize that Abeta precursor protein (APP) is a sensor at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that detects, and signals to the nucleus, abnormalities in axonal transport. When persistently activated, due to chronically slowed-down transport, this signaling pathway leads to accumulation of Abeta within the ER. Methods and Results: We tested this hypothesis with the neuronal cell line CAD. We show that, normally, a fraction of APP is transported into neurites by recruiting kinesin-1 via the adaptor protein, Fe65. Under conditions that block kinesin-1-dependent transport, APP, Fe65 and kinesin-1 accumulate in the soma, and form a complex at the ER.This complex recruits active c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which phosphorylates APP at Thr(668). This phosphorylation increases the cleavage of APP by the amyloidogenic pathway, which generates Abeta within the ER lumen, and releases Fe65 into the cytoplasm. Part of the released Fe65 translocates into the nucleus, likely to initiate a gene transcription response to arrested transport. Prolonged arrest of kinesin-1-dependent transport could thus lead to accumulation and oligomerization of Abeta in the ER. Conclusion: These results support a model where the APP:Fe65 complex is a sensor at the ER for detecting the increased level of kinesin-1 caused by halted transport, which signals to the nucleus, while concomitantly generating an oligomerization-prone pool of Abeta in the ER.

Similarly, the adaptor proteins Shc and Grb2 can bind AbetaPP (or its CTFs) in the presence of phosphorylated tyrosine in this motif. However, AbetaPP (or its CTFs) and the AbetaPP-related proteins, APLP1 and APLP2, can also interact with several other signalling proteins, including X11, Fe65, mDab, c-Abl, JIP-1, and Numb, independently of the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue within the YENPTY motif. From a functional point of view, the interaction between the neuron-specific adaptor protein Fe65 and AbetaPP via the second PTB domain of Fe65 was shown to modulate AbetaPP processing, favoring the generation of Abeta and AbetaPP trafficking, in several cell lines. Another adaptor that binds to AbetaPP is mDAB. It is a protein related to the Reelin subgraph and interacting with YENPTY motif through a PTB domain. mDAB is active during embryogenesis, where it regulates the position of neurons in the brain laminar structure, and mDAB binding increases the amounts of mature AbetaPP and Abeta formation. On the contrary, X11 stabilizes AbetaPP conformation in membrane, inhibiting Abeta secretion in cultured cells, likely impairing AbetaPP trafficking to sites containing active gamma-secretase complexes. JIP's are member of JNK-scaffolding family proteins kinases, implicated in different signal pathway, including neuronal apoptotic process. JNK-interacting proteins JIP1b and JIP2 bind to the cytoplasmic tail of AbetaPP. The expression of JIP1b stabilizes immature AbetaPP and decreases the AbetaPP ectodomain, Abeta40/Abeta42 and CTFs abundance.All these observations suggest that some of these protein-protein interactions may play a role in the modulation of the amyloidogenic pathway and thus might have a role in neurodegeneration.", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "reference": "22496686"}, "annotations": {"Condition": {"Normal Healthy State": true}, "Subgraph": {"Amyloidogenic subgraph": true, "Gap junctions subgraph": true, "Reelin signaling subgraph": true}, "Confidence": {"Medium": true}}, "source": 559, "target": 235, "key": "3418b4f2809e57135e8e1fc3045ab7c1b2852749a93a1845f99c938084b7f5caaa718b993ffd5b9c32bd60fe4aeae4966f40bf79c73310c03ba2d2ab0423ba1b"}, {"line": 2921, "relation": "decreases", "evidence": "Upon binding, LRP8 transduces reelin signaling during neuronal development, and recent evidence has indicated that it interacts with the NR2A and NR2B subunits of NMDA receptor, being involved in neuronal functions such as maturation of NMDA receptor composition in the hippocampus, and the regulation of long-term potentiation.

ÃÆÃÂ¸1 integrin interacts with Reelin, and this interaction is important for its effects on neuronal migration.we observed that interactions between Reelin, APP, and a3ÃÆÃÂ¸1 integrin promote neurite outgrowth in cultured neurons and that APP and Reelin affected dendritic processes in vivo.", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "name": "J Neurosci. 2009 Jun 10;29(23):7459-73.", "reference": "19515914"}, "annotations": {"Subgraph": {"Amyloidogenic subgraph": true, "Low density lipoprotein subgraph": true, "Reelin signaling subgraph": true}, "Confidence": {"Medium": true}}, "source": 500, "target": 117, "key": "ad3bc88bc118e1dd729e32787af3e102ae1cae120ae8cc2789201b1e4a4e602e0069f09e4e67b235b7d8947c7e5b55961b70884da8ac60a2770d10e787f81751"}, {"line": 44538, "relation": "association", "evidence": "APP/APLP expression is up-regulated during neuronal maturation and differentiation, undergoes rapid anterograde transport, and is targeted in vesicles distinct from synaptophysin transport vesicles to synaptic sites", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "name": "Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med. 2012 Feb;2(2):a006288.", "reference": "22355794"}, "annotations": {"Confidence": {"Medium": true}, "Subgraph": {"Amyloidogenic subgraph": true}}, "source": 116, "target": 357, "key": "73a8ef191d203e66821ef5d5821faa44bedb4cf5cb884e799dde1780b555458ef1cb81fe6c978858034c202682e9967f3fab6b680d377dc16772b2099a6e48ea"}, {"line": 44540, "relation": "association", "evidence": "APP/APLP expression is up-regulated during neuronal maturation and differentiation, undergoes rapid anterograde transport, and is targeted in vesicles distinct from synaptophysin transport vesicles to synaptic sites", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "name": "Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med. 2012 Feb;2(2):a006288.", "reference": "22355794"}, "annotations": {"Confidence": {"Medium": true}, "Subgraph": {"Amyloidogenic subgraph": true}}, "source": 116, "target": 352, "key": "dcb79ef6c13d3d0172eb8b6d5b8bc6e5b39e61f8fd38a3f5869aa1651b1bdf290aa85a875eda52d83f67d70832c6a91bb54bb2509a4c87d71baefb87bad6f7ba"}, {"line": 44553, "relation": "association", "evidence": "Investigations of conserved domains support an adhesion property for all members of the APP family.

The present review raises the hypothesis that the onset of AD pathology is closely related with mitochondrial dysfunction induced by Abeta and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) axonal transport deficits. It is well-known that axonal transport defect and attenuation of BDNF-neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase 2 (TrkB) signal are fatal to neuronal function and survival.We hypothesized that abnormal amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and Abeta production in mitochondria disturb the axonal transport by impairing mitochondrial function and attenuate BDNF-neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase 2 signal subsequently.For this hypothesis, the factors related with the initiation of AD pathology are not only limited to the neurons per se but also expanded to the microenvironment around neurons, such as the secretion of BDNF from astrocytes.

Arc is a postsynaptic protein that recruits endophilin2/3 and dynamin to early/recycling endosomes that traffic AMPA receptors to reduce synaptic strength in both hebbian and non-hebbian forms of plasticity. The Arc-endosome also traffics APP and BACE1, and Arc physically associates with presenilin1 (PS1) to regulate gamma-secretase trafficking and confer activity dependence.", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "reference": "22036569"}, "annotations": {"Condition": {"Normal Healthy State": true}, "Subgraph": {"Amyloidogenic subgraph": true, "Glutamatergic subgraph": true}, "Confidence": {"High": true}}, "object": {"modifier": "Translocation", "effect": {"fromLoc": {"namespace": "MESHCS", "name": "Cell Membrane"}, "toLoc": {"namespace": "MESHCS", "name": "Endosomes"}}}, "source": 388, "target": 357, "key": "0856d6bca535ec0d3714c68588d0b5c77447c4a65b17605bf5920d2511ef232b8e320431e0b743594c73a417991cbc8cd28cf172659ccd9151f83f814bf8f7c7"}, {"line": 55033, "relation": "association", "evidence": "After false discovery rate correction, we observed 53 significant associations between SNPs and our imaging features, including associations of ventricular enlargement with SNPs on estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) and sortilin-related VPS10 domain containing receptor 1 (SORCS1), hippocampal atrophy with SNPs on ESR1, and cerebral atrophy with SNPs on transferrin (TF) and amyloid beta precursor protein (APP).", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "reference": "25570489"}, "annotations": {"Subgraph": {"Amyloidogenic subgraph": true}, "Confidence": {"High": true}}, "source": 59, "target": 357, "key": "c3b27bed1920c08226610de469a58c95235b1acdca1bfa656ca62040d853a40a2898c50236e9ea1e4fe9620cef16e238cb3c5243f8a62bbf08a7e74365449cbf"}, {"line": 55272, "relation": "negativeCorrelation", "evidence": "At baseline, amyloid-beta positive patients with mild cognitive impairment showed increased hippocampal activation, smaller hippocampal volumes, and a trend towards lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores and higher Clinical Dementia Ratings compared to amyloid-beta negative patients with mild cognitive impairment.", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "name": "Brain. 2015 Apr;138(Pt 4):1023-35. doi: 10.1093/brain/awv007.", "reference": "25678559"}, "annotations": {"Confidence": {"High": true}, "Subgraph": {"Amyloidogenic subgraph": true}}, "source": 65, "target": 357, "key": "bc4916665169362537a03e47fdc4d72f1e29a175006ea8dfcd8d78aad791b83fb86c248505bdee0b3f92acb3bb8570ea3f5d32b9b2ea8d3d672dddd3167864b8"}, {"line": 55273, "relation": "negativeCorrelation", "evidence": "At baseline, amyloid-beta positive patients with mild cognitive impairment showed increased hippocampal activation, smaller hippocampal volumes, and a trend towards lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores and higher Clinical Dementia Ratings compared to amyloid-beta negative patients with mild cognitive impairment.", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "name": "Brain. 2015 Apr;138(Pt 4):1023-35. doi: 10.1093/brain/awv007.", "reference": "25678559"}, "annotations": {"Confidence": {"High": true}, "Subgraph": {"Amyloidogenic subgraph": true}}, "source": 66, "target": 357, "key": "8d61e5906461656bd324567217101e64cbb02ba0cb1789245e1ba7ac0b14b958f69d32ade90b34216cfc36ce749339cc72d2f4cfd136c637beaae35e629d9032"}, {"line": 55274, "relation": "positiveCorrelation", "evidence": "At baseline, amyloid-beta positive patients with mild cognitive impairment showed increased hippocampal activation, smaller hippocampal volumes, and a trend towards lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores and higher Clinical Dementia Ratings compared to amyloid-beta negative patients with mild cognitive impairment.", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "name": "Brain. 2015 Apr;138(Pt 4):1023-35. doi: 10.1093/brain/awv007.", "reference": "25678559"}, "annotations": {"Confidence": {"High": true}, "Subgraph": {"Amyloidogenic subgraph": true}}, "source": 60, "target": 357, "key": "61b4548c8c141b288fd19612f2c5f287e95dc85c046c79eda059a6be209e497de2ad043beaa0396036556b3d1f951bb81fba4e221578bd358ca5ffdc9c04adee"}, {"line": 55287, "relation": "positiveCorrelation", "evidence": "The strong correlation between hippocampal atrophy and beta-amyloid (Abeta) burden in the Pittsburgh compound B-positive healthy control group suggests that Abeta deposition in the inferior temporal neocortex is related to hippocampal synaptic and neuronal degeneration", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "name": "Neurology. 2010 Jan 12;74(2):121-7.", "reference": "20065247"}, "annotations": {"Subgraph": {"Amyloidogenic subgraph": true}, "Confidence": {"High": true}}, "source": 64, "target": 357, "key": "246bc26735aa614be2245536b531289138a0e92d11a506e5cbf67d5d09ade587270d13d56de383d7a433b96e998814ba19ca898dae94fb8714dcdd27b80891c9"}, {"line": 229, "relation": "negativeCorrelation", "evidence": "Here, we show that siRNA-mediated loss of calsyntenin-1 in cultured neurons alters APP processing to increase production of Abeta.

This interaction may facilitate its anchoring in the inner membrane and disturbance of the mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial swelling and cell death. Interestingly, the MPTP also requires the participation of members of the Bcl-2 family proteins but a clear understanding of the interaction of Abeta with CypD together with both proapoptotic or antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins in AD has not been made. The ability of CypD to protect neurons from Abeta- and oxidative stress-induced cell death and its role in improvement of synaptic and cognitive functions has been suggested to provide a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of conditions associated with AD. Together these studies provide new mechanisms for Abeta targets that link the MPTP to synaptic stress and the neurodegeneration seen in AD.", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "reference": "20847424"}, "annotations": {"Disease": {"Alzheimer's disease": true}, "Subgraph": {"Amyloidogenic subgraph": true, "Mitochondrial translocation subgraph": true}, "Confidence": {"Medium": true}}, "source": 567, "target": 10, "key": "67464d40d205a39ddfd17b228d2c72696c24bd353f763178d4d1d654e7924853c6b1bc3746170a8f903aff6a6f83abb93fc4bb187807fadde4457c282951c9fe"}, {"line": 8817, "relation": "negativeCorrelation", "evidence": "The pathogenesis of AD begins with impaired synaptic function, which may result from the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide (5ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬8).

Similarly, the adaptor proteins Shc and Grb2 can bind AbetaPP (or its CTFs) in the presence of phosphorylated tyrosine in this motif. However, AbetaPP (or its CTFs) and the AbetaPP-related proteins, APLP1 and APLP2, can also interact with several other signalling proteins, including X11, Fe65, mDab, c-Abl, JIP-1, and Numb, independently of the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue within the YENPTY motif. From a functional point of view, the interaction between the neuron-specific adaptor protein Fe65 and AbetaPP via the second PTB domain of Fe65 was shown to modulate AbetaPP processing, favoring the generation of Abeta and AbetaPP trafficking, in several cell lines. Another adaptor that binds to AbetaPP is mDAB. It is a protein related to the Reelin subgraph and interacting with YENPTY motif through a PTB domain. mDAB is active during embryogenesis, where it regulates the position of neurons in the brain laminar structure, and mDAB binding increases the amounts of mature AbetaPP and Abeta formation. On the contrary, X11 stabilizes AbetaPP conformation in membrane, inhibiting Abeta secretion in cultured cells, likely impairing AbetaPP trafficking to sites containing active gamma-secretase complexes. JIP's are member of JNK-scaffolding family proteins kinases, implicated in different signal pathway, including neuronal apoptotic process. JNK-interacting proteins JIP1b and JIP2 bind to the cytoplasmic tail of AbetaPP. The expression of JIP1b stabilizes immature AbetaPP and decreases the AbetaPP ectodomain, Abeta40/Abeta42 and CTFs abundance.All these observations suggest that some of these protein-protein interactions may play a role in the modulation of the amyloidogenic pathway and thus might have a role in neurodegeneration.", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "reference": "22496686"}, "annotations": {"Condition": {"Normal Healthy State": true}, "Subgraph": {"Amyloidogenic subgraph": true, "Akt subgraph": true}, "Confidence": {"High": true}}, "source": 511, "target": 274, "key": "0bc814145977233c76fe745a401c303f00246a631b5c4a09566c14173e9bb7befa6b6da273311b69f85eedae2d6fa05639556d5fdfccae7beb946750801c0d38"}, {"line": 38724, "relation": "increases", "evidence": "Amyloid beta protein precursor is phosphorylated by JNK-1 independent of, yet facilitated by, JNK-interacting protein (JIP)-1.", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "name": "J Biol Chem2003", "reference": "12917434"}, "annotations": {"Subgraph": {"Amyloidogenic subgraph": true, "MAPK-JNK subgraph": true}, "Confidence": {"Medium": true}}, "source": 511, "target": 370, "key": "fbe6d88e23f4193230c41752284764b8c7004517e3b00ab50349a1773ab4b4c825c9d4aa3e5807e096afa0800d0953b6707b4362bf709d2fe0b3000989708ce2"}, {"line": 39759, "relation": "association", "evidence": "Our observations indicate that Bim is a proapoptotic effector of Abeta and of dysregulated cell cycle proteins in AD and identify both Bim and cell cycle elements as potential therapeutic targets.", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "name": "The journal of neuroscience2007", "reference": "17251431"}, "annotations": {"Subgraph": {"Amyloidogenic subgraph": true, "Bcl-2 subgraph": true}, "Confidence": {"Medium": true}}, "source": 397, "target": 10, "key": "25ed2a06a4f3c6d8cb46ed7967c2dcf6c2c80b0c89acca82e4869ab112804137a3e678430ca5da090f6e3b7eaa9f87aba7894773fa6f9086dd5f8b6ea59dec3d"}, {"line": 40020, "relation": "association", "evidence": "SorLA has been shown to be down regulated in Alzheimer's disease brains, interact with ApoE, and pmodulate Abeta production", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "name": "Molecular Neurodegeneration2006", "reference": "16930450"}, "annotations": {"Subgraph": {"Amyloidogenic subgraph": true, "Low density lipoprotein subgraph": true}, "Confidence": {"Medium": true}}, "source": 576, "target": 10, "key": "f4a7a232f021b6bce83aaf70d938a952399a56de8e57b71c30d86a91942a00c3820d35f13eeac7f39fae0d09c63ccd772b71232d40530fc972eeadce5bc2e4d4"}, {"line": 8019, "relation": "increases", "evidence": "Cirrito et al.

Proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein by alpha-secretase ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10) protects the brain from the production of the Abeta. Meanwhile, dysregulation or aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been widely documented in AD patients. In this study, we demonstrated that overexpression of miR-144, which was previously reported to be increased in elderly primate brains and AD patients, significantly decreased activity of the luciferase reporter containing the ADAM10 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) and suppressed the ADAM10 protein level, whereas the miR-144 inhibitor led to an increase of the luciferase activity. The negative regulation caused by miR-144 was strictly dependent on the binding of the miRNA to its recognition element in the ADAM10 3'-UTR. Moreover, we also showed that activator protein-1 regulates the transcription of miR-144 and the up-regulation of miR-144 at least partially induces the suppression of the ADAM10 protein in the presence of Abeta. In addition, we found that miR-451, a miRNA processed from a single gene locus with miR-144, is also involved in the regulation of ADAM10 expression.

Similarly, the adaptor proteins Shc and Grb2 can bind AbetaPP (or its CTFs) in the presence of phosphorylated tyrosine in this motif. However, AbetaPP (or its CTFs) and the AbetaPP-related proteins, APLP1 and APLP2, can also interact with several other signalling proteins, including X11, Fe65, mDab, c-Abl, JIP-1, and Numb, independently of the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue within the YENPTY motif. From a functional point of view, the interaction between the neuron-specific adaptor protein Fe65 and AbetaPP via the second PTB domain of Fe65 was shown to modulate AbetaPP processing, favoring the generation of Abeta and AbetaPP trafficking, in several cell lines. Another adaptor that binds to AbetaPP is mDAB. It is a protein related to the Reelin subgraph and interacting with YENPTY motif through a PTB domain. mDAB is active during embryogenesis, where it regulates the position of neurons in the brain laminar structure, and mDAB binding increases the amounts of mature AbetaPP and Abeta formation. On the contrary, X11 stabilizes AbetaPP conformation in membrane, inhibiting Abeta secretion in cultured cells, likely impairing AbetaPP trafficking to sites containing active gamma-secretase complexes. JIP's are member of JNK-scaffolding family proteins kinases, implicated in different signal pathway, including neuronal apoptotic process. JNK-interacting proteins JIP1b and JIP2 bind to the cytoplasmic tail of AbetaPP. The expression of JIP1b stabilizes immature AbetaPP and decreases the AbetaPP ectodomain, Abeta40/Abeta42 and CTFs abundance.All these observations suggest that some of these protein-protein interactions may play a role in the modulation of the amyloidogenic pathway and thus might have a role in neurodegeneration.", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "reference": "22496686"}, "annotations": {"Condition": {"Normal Healthy State": true}, "Subgraph": {"Amyloidogenic subgraph": true, "Beta secretase subgraph": true}, "Confidence": {"High": true}}, "source": 344, "target": 274, "key": "aaed8de50e258d63aee18096a387fe64fa30edd775e3572fff3c399792f4e7149a42d9fb121feef7f4048bdf78581b870640618d6bdb4def1dd8fe71d52eac93"}, {"line": 3364, "relation": "association", "evidence": "Mint adaptor proteins bind to the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and regulate APP processing associated with Alzheimer's disease; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying Mint regulation in APP binding and processing remain unclear.

The crystal structure of a C-terminally extended Mint1 PTB fragment reveals that the linker region forms a short a-helix that folds back onto the PTB domain and sterically hinders APP binding. This intramolecular interaction is disrupted by mutation of Tyr633 within the Mint1 autoinhibitory helix leading to enhanced APP binding and Abeta-amyloid production.

Meanwhile, dysregulation or aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been widely documented in AD patients. In this study, we demonstrated that overexpression of miR-144, which was previously reported to be increased in elderly primate brains and AD patients, significantly decreased activity of the luciferase reporter containing the ADAM10 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) and suppressed the ADAM10 protein level, whereas the miR-144 inhibitor led to an increase of the luciferase activity. The negative regulation caused by miR-144 was strictly dependent on the binding of the miRNA to its recognition element in the ADAM10 3'-UTR. Moreover, we also showed that activator protein-1 regulates the transcription of miR-144 and the up-regulation of miR-144 at least partially induces the suppression of the ADAM10 protein in the presence of Abeta. In addition, we found that miR-451, a miRNA processed from a single gene locus with miR-144, is also involved in the regulation of ADAM10 expression.

Thus, the process of amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage is a key event and has raised much attention in the field of AD research. It is proposed that APP, beta- and gamma-secretases are all located on the lipid raft, and the meeting of them is an indispensable step for Abeta generation. Endocytosis can lead to clustering of APP, beta- and gamma-secretases from separate smaller lipid rafts into a larger one. On the other hand, for myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS), phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) or interaction with Ca(2+) can lead to its release from membrane into cytoplasm. This process induces the release of actins and phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP2), which are important factors for endocytosis.

However, AbetaPP (or its CTFs) and the AbetaPP-related proteins, APLP1 and APLP2, can also interact with several other signalling proteins, including X11, Fe65, mDab, c-Abl, JIP-1, and Numb, independently of the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue within the YENPTY motif. From a functional point of view, the interaction between the neuron-specific adaptor protein Fe65 and AbetaPP via the second PTB domain of Fe65 was shown to modulate AbetaPP processing, favoring the generation of Abeta and AbetaPP trafficking, in several cell lines. Another adaptor that binds to AbetaPP is mDAB. It is a protein related to the Reelin subgraph and interacting with YENPTY motif through a PTB domain. mDAB is active during embryogenesis, where it regulates the position of neurons in the brain laminar structure, and mDAB binding increases the amounts of mature AbetaPP and Abeta formation. On the contrary, X11 stabilizes AbetaPP conformation in membrane, inhibiting Abeta secretion in cultured cells, likely impairing AbetaPP trafficking to sites containing active gamma-secretase complexes. JIP's are member of JNK-scaffolding family proteins kinases, implicated in different signal pathway, including neuronal apoptotic process. JNK-interacting proteins JIP1b and JIP2 bind to the cytoplasmic tail of AbetaPP. The expression of JIP1b stabilizes immature AbetaPP and decreases the AbetaPP ectodomain, Abeta40/Abeta42 and CTFs abundance.All these observations suggest that some of these protein-protein interactions may play a role in the modulation of the amyloidogenic pathway and thus might have a role in neurodegeneration.", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "reference": "22496686"}, "annotations": {"Condition": {"Normal Healthy State": true}, "Subgraph": {"Amyloidogenic subgraph": true, "Beta secretase subgraph": true}, "Confidence": {"High": true}}, "source": 348, "target": 274, "key": "5a2db6f8987d991df1766779e3653be34c5143f4bd8ffe792d1eee56d1adb63dcb7ac99e92ff9352c2098e1869afc9c206768e0a04eb8949d03ae2c1692c5672"}, {"line": 37898, "relation": "regulates", "evidence": "APP-dependent transcription mediated by Fe65 is blocked by p75(NTR)", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "name": "Ann Neurol2009", "reference": "19334058"}, "annotations": {"Subgraph": {"Amyloidogenic subgraph": true, "Nerve growth factor subgraph": true}, "Confidence": {"Medium": true}}, "subject": {"modifier": "Activity"}, "source": 348, "target": 357, "key": "64789d35ea7d87b17b5eaa9a6ef5b163b6b8a9f9aace19650e059988d129c2206d99509782d01ad2945c58d8efb957452b7468c7e6a4921590cfacdf0fb56dec"}, {"line": 39458, "relation": "association", "evidence": "This suggests a role for FE65 in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD).", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "name": "The American Journal of Pathology2001", "reference": "11337355"}, "annotations": {"Subgraph": {"Amyloidogenic subgraph": true}, "Confidence": {"High": true}}, "source": 348, "target": 616, "key": "5d4168e3a9b0d20493b8350c4b43797a69fd8907bf3bfdbed8c6f08ac95b587ace8289d4015ea0b5cac4d8e26ab290926c1ade9df330e8914b89e98d18099c59"}, {"line": 39480, "relation": "decreases", "evidence": "We report here that (i) a single amino acid mutation at the Thr-668 residue of APP695, located 14 amino acids toward the amino-terminal end from the (682)YENPTY(687) motif, reduced the interaction between members of the Fe65 family of proteins and APP, whereas interaction of APP with the phosphotyrosine interaction domain of other APP binders such as X11-like and mammalian disabled-1 was not influenced by this mutation; (ii) the phosphorylation of APP at Thr-668 diminished the interaction of APP with Fe65 by causing a conformational change in the cytoplasmic domain that contains the Fe65-binding motif, YENPTY; and (iii) the expression of Fe65 slightly suppressed maturation of APP and decreased production of beta-amyloid (Abeta).", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "name": "Journal of Biological Chemistry2001", "reference": "11517218"}, "annotations": {"Subgraph": {"Amyloidogenic subgraph": true}, "Confidence": {"Medium": true}}, "source": 348, "target": 10, "key": "e89c0f85e6fa8c0d467e9d27ab88533350ae37a9fdd128a12e637ef90bd58afe7cbf936f03fb4646988aabb65fc749353d9f51d2421d03ad5bb539e45362538d"}, {"line": 44501, "relation": "increases", "evidence": "Although the requirements for binding of Fe65 and X11 to the GYENPTY motif differ slightly, they are sufficiently overlapping to make it conceivable that these proteins compete for binding to APP.

LMP is a potentially lethal event because the ectopic presence of lysosomal proteases in the cytosol causes digestion of vital proteins and the activation of additional hydrolases including caspases. This latter process is usually mediated indirectly, through a cascade in which LMP causes the proteolytic activation of Bid (which is cleaved by the two lysosomal cathepsins B and D). The Bid activation then induces mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, resulting in cytochrome c release and apoptosome-dependent caspase activation [19].

Abnormal accumulation of amyloid is Amyloidosis, a term associated with diseased organs and tissues, particularly neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntingdon's. Amyloid deposits consist predominantly of amyloid fibrils, rigid, non-branching structures that form ordered assemblies, characteristically with a cross beta-sheet structure where the sheets run parallel to the direction of the fibril (Sawaya et al. 2007). Often the fibril has a left-handed twist (Nelson & Eisenberg 2006). At least 27 human proteins form amyloid fibrils (Sipe et al. 2010). Many of these proteins have non-pathological functions; the trigger that leads to abnormal aggregations differs between proteins and is not well understood but in many cases the peptides are abnormal fragments or mutant forms arising from polymorphisms, suggesting that the initial event may be aggregation of misfolded or unfolded peptides. Early studies of Amyloid-Beta assembly led to a widely accepted model that assembly was a nucleation-dependent polymerization reaction (Teplow 1998) but it is now understood to be more complex, with multiple 'off-pathway' events leading to a variety of oligomeric structures in addition to fibrils (Roychaudhuri et al. 2008). An increasing body of evidence suggests that these oligomeric forms are primarily responsible for the neurotoxic effects of Amyloid-beta (Roychaudhuri et al. 2008), alpha-synuclein (Winner et al. 2011) and tau (Dance & Strobel 2009, Meraz-Rios et al. 2010). Amyloid oligomers are believed to have a common structural motif that is independent of the protein involved and not present in fibrils (Kayed et al. 2003). Conformation dependent, aggregation specific antibodies suggest that there are 3 general classes of amyloid oligomer structures (Glabe 2009) including annular structures which may be responsible for the widely reported membrane permeabilization effect of amyloid oligomers. Toxicity of amyloid oligomers preceeds the appearance of plaques in mouse models (Ferretti et al. 2011).

Similarly, the adaptor proteins Shc and Grb2 can bind AbetaPP (or its CTFs) in the presence of phosphorylated tyrosine in this motif. However, AbetaPP (or its CTFs) and the AbetaPP-related proteins, APLP1 and APLP2, can also interact with several other signalling proteins, including X11, Fe65, mDab, c-Abl, JIP-1, and Numb, independently of the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue within the YENPTY motif. From a functional point of view, the interaction between the neuron-specific adaptor protein Fe65 and AbetaPP via the second PTB domain of Fe65 was shown to modulate AbetaPP processing, favoring the generation of Abeta and AbetaPP trafficking, in several cell lines. Another adaptor that binds to AbetaPP is mDAB.

precursor protein (APP) mutations associated with familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) usually lead to increases in amyloid Abeta-protein (Abeta) levels or aggregation. Here, we identified a novel APP mutation, located within the Abeta sequence (Abeta(D7H)), in a Taiwanese family with early onset AD and explored the pathogenicity of this mutation. Cellular and biochemical analysis reveal that this mutation increased Abeta production, Abeta42/40 ratio and prolonged Abeta42 oligomer state with higher neurotoxicity. Because the D7H mutant Abeta has an additional metal ion-coordinating residue, histidine, we speculate that this mutation may promote susceptibility of Abeta to ion. When co-incubated with Zn(2+) or Cu(2+), Abeta(D7H) aggregated into low molecular weight oligomers. Together, the D7H mutation could contribute to AD pathology through a double punch effect on elevating both Abeta production and oligomerization. Although the pathogenic nature of this mutation needs further confirmation, our findings suggest that the Abeta N-terminal region potentially modulates APP processing and Abeta aggregation, and further provides a genetic indication of the importance of Zn(2+) and Cu(2+) in the etiology of AD.Our result indicates that the D7H mutation promotes Abeta40 interaction with Zn2+ and Cu2+, where the Abeta interaction with Zn2+ is especially enhanced by the mutation", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "name": "PLoS One. 2012;7(4):e35807.

Our results offer an affirmative answer, suggesting a mechanism for the abnormal production of amyloid-beta (Abeta), triggered by the slowed axonal transport at old age. We hypothesize that Abeta precursor protein (APP) is a sensor at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that detects, and signals to the nucleus, abnormalities in axonal transport. When persistently activated, due to chronically slowed-down transport, this signaling pathway leads to accumulation of Abeta within the ER. Methods and Results: We tested this hypothesis with the neuronal cell line CAD. We show that, normally, a fraction of APP is transported into neurites by recruiting kinesin-1 via the adaptor protein, Fe65. Under conditions that block kinesin-1-dependent transport, APP, Fe65 and kinesin-1 accumulate in the soma, and form a complex at the ER.This complex recruits active c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which phosphorylates APP at Thr(668). This phosphorylation increases the cleavage of APP by the amyloidogenic pathway, which generates Abeta within the ER lumen, and releases Fe65 into the cytoplasm. Part of the released Fe65 translocates into the nucleus, likely to initiate a gene transcription response to arrested transport. Prolonged arrest of kinesin-1-dependent transport could thus lead to accumulation and oligomerization of Abeta in the ER. Conclusion: These results support a model where the APP:Fe65 complex is a sensor at the ER for detecting the increased level of kinesin-1 caused by halted transport, which signals to the nucleus, while concomitantly generating an oligomerization-prone pool of Abeta in the ER.

This phosphorylation increases the cleavage of APP by the amyloidogenic pathway, which generates Abeta within the ER lumen, and releases Fe65 into the cytoplasm. Part of the released Fe65 translocates into the nucleus, likely to initiate a gene transcription response to arrested transport. Prolonged arrest of kinesin-1-dependent transport could thus lead to accumulation and oligomerization of Abeta in the ER. Conclusion: These results support a model where the APP:Fe65 complex is a sensor at the ER for detecting the increased level of kinesin-1 caused by halted transport, which signals to the nucleus, while concomitantly generating an oligomerization-prone pool of Abeta in the ER. Our hypothesis could thus explain a pathogenic mechanism in AD.", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "name": "Neurodegener Dis. 2012;10(1-4):60-3.

The permeabilization of the lysosome has been shown to initiate a cell death pathway in specific circumstances. Lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) causes the release of cathepsins and other hydrolases from the lysosomal lumen to the cytosol. LMP is a potentially lethal event because the ectopic presence of lysosomal proteases in the cytosol causes digestion of vital proteins and the activation of additional hydrolases including caspases. This latter process is usually mediated indirectly, through a cascade in which LMP causes the proteolytic activation of Bid (which is cleaved by the two lysosomal cathepsins B and D).

Abnormal accumulation of amyloid is Amyloidosis, a term associated with diseased organs and tissues, particularly neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntingdon's. Amyloid deposits consist predominantly of amyloid fibrils, rigid, non-branching structures that form ordered assemblies, characteristically with a cross beta-sheet structure where the sheets run parallel to the direction of the fibril (Sawaya et al. 2007). Often the fibril has a left-handed twist (Nelson & Eisenberg 2006). At least 27 human proteins form amyloid fibrils (Sipe et al. 2010). Many of these proteins have non-pathological functions; the trigger that leads to abnormal aggregations differs between proteins and is not well understood but in many cases the peptides are abnormal fragments or mutant forms arising from polymorphisms, suggesting that the initial event may be aggregation of misfolded or unfolded peptides. Early studies of Amyloid-Beta assembly led to a widely accepted model that assembly was a nucleation-dependent polymerization reaction (Teplow 1998) but it is now understood to be more complex, with multiple 'off-pathway' events leading to a variety of oligomeric structures in addition to fibrils (Roychaudhuri et al. 2008). An increasing body of evidence suggests that these oligomeric forms are primarily responsible for the neurotoxic effects of Amyloid-beta (Roychaudhuri et al. 2008), alpha-synuclein (Winner et al. 2011) and tau (Dance & Strobel 2009, Meraz-Rios et al. 2010). Amyloid oligomers are believed to have a common structural motif that is independent of the protein involved and not present in fibrils (Kayed et al. 2003). Conformation dependent, aggregation specific antibodies suggest that there are 3 general classes of amyloid oligomer structures (Glabe 2009) including annular structures which may be responsible for the widely reported membrane permeabilization effect of amyloid oligomers. Toxicity of amyloid oligomers preceeds the appearance of plaques in mouse models (Ferretti et al. 2011). Fibrils are often associated with other molecules, notably heparan sulfate proteoglycans and Serum Amyloid P-component, which are universally associated and seem to stabilize fibrils, possibly by protecting them from degradation.", "citation": {"type": "Online Resource", "name": "Amyloids", "reference": "REACT_75925.2"}, "annotations": {"Subgraph": {"Amyloidogenic subgraph": true}, "Confidence": {"Medium": true}}, "source": 623, "target": 630, "key": "7f83e8f1c851bf978ef0b45ac87d7fe4efc1559243dd685e3dbc743a6d2934d146c0a71431b34cc0ccda6200ee395db260ccca67c3fa69271c6018af8df4e0a6"}, {"line": 49611, "relation": "association", "evidence": "Ccl2 affects beta-amyloidosis and progressive neurocognitive dysfunction in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "name": "Neurobiology of aging; Vol. 34; Iss. 4", "reference": "23040664"}, "annotations": {"MeSHDisease": {"Plaque, Amyloid": true, "Alzheimer Disease": true}, "Species": {"10090": true}, "Confidence": {"High": true}, "Subgraph": {"Amyloidogenic subgraph": true, "Chemokine signaling subgraph": true}}, "source": 594, "target": 630, "key": "7dbd049a242fc27fd852fe7f548a1a11a4fa819ebc352d5eb09bd1f231812d8e750e505e8e29bbbfbe4346d63e373ab9f69d98777bf6ab44839368baa41950d0"}, {"line": 10756, "relation": "increases", "evidence": "CerebraiiR/IGF-1 signaling in APP metabolism.

Through further subfractionation, using sucrose gradients, we showed that metformin treatment caused changes in the compartmentalization of APP, as evidenced by increased distribution in trans-Golgi network (TGN) vesicles (fraction 2), including those trafficks en route to early endosomes and TGN (fraction 3), and decreased distribution in membranes (fraction 5) (Fig. S1 B and C). BACE1 protein levels were found to be elevated in all 3 fractions: 2, 3, and 5, with an Ã¢â°Ë2-fold increase of the total protein. The increased distribution of both APP and BACE1 in fractions 2 and 3 are expected to favor Abeta generation within TGN and/or endocytic compartments, the two compartments with mild acidic pH optimal for BACE1 activity (33, 34).

Additionally, Fe65 has been reported to mediate nuclear signalling in combination with intracellular domains of APP and LRP1. We have previously identified another adaptor protein, GULP1 (engulfment adaptor PTB-domain-containing 1). In the present study we characterize and compare nuclear trafficking and transactivation of GULP1 and Fe65 together with APP and LRP1 and report differential nuclear trafficking of adaptors when APP or LRP1 are co-expressed.

ROCK2, the neuronal isoform of another protein kinase, was found to form complexes with SorL1, and both ROCK2 inhibition and ROCK2 knockdown enhanced generation of both soluble APP and ABetaÂ¸.These results highlight the potential importance of SorL1 in elucidating phospho-state sensitive mechanisms in the regulation of metabolism of APP and ABetaÂ¸ by PKC and ROCK2.", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "name": "Mol Neurodegener. 2010 Dec 30;5:62.", "reference": "21192821"}, "annotations": {"Subgraph": {"Amyloidogenic subgraph": true, "RhoA subgraph": true, "Low density lipoprotein subgraph": true}, "Confidence": {"Medium": true}}, "source": 266, "target": 50, "key": "1abb8ccac1ca75f6427be6d58d87dfc662d4403c7340dbf763f17efcde1cd2c7b1a1cf612f9ea530aea616330491c1134f5b447cc492c5a2ec2ee9b2565e61ff"}, {"line": 43323, "relation": "increases", "evidence": "Picomolar extracellular ABetaÂ¸ also binds nAChR, glutamate receptors (NMDAR) and Ca2+ ion channels (e.g. VDCCs, TRPC) and causes Ca2+ influx at controlled rates into the cytoplasm and mitochondria.", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "reference": "20847424"}, "annotations": {"Subgraph": {"Amyloidogenic subgraph": true, "Glutamatergic subgraph": true, "Acetylcholine signaling subgraph": true}, "Confidence": {"Medium": true}}, "source": 188, "target": 120, "key": "838cd55c77ca9c7d6c453869d671d89e8afc462c74ce4bb73eca786afa905b50ab6d95caa09dbe5dfce86f7296fcbf36941ca0c93ddf5b8158f1431c479263b4"}, {"line": 45109, "relation": "regulates", "evidence": "Iron was further demonstrated to modulate expression of the Alzheimer's amyloid precursor holo-protein (APP) by a mechanism similar to that of regulation of ferritin-L and -H mRNA translation through an iron-responsive element (IRE) in their 5' untranslated regions (UTRs).
