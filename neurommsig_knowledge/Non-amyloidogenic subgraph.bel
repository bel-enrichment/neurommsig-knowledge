The most promising of these compounds is called probucol. Administration of probucol, an old cholesterol lowering drug, in mild to moderate sporadic AD led to significant increases in CSF apoE levels and a decrease of CSF beta amyloid 1-42 without significant modifications of CSF tau concentration or CSF lipid peroxides levels. These results are consistent with recent reports suggesting that the long term use of cholesterol lowering drugs that block 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) activity in the fourth and fifth decade of life may help reduce the risk of developing AD at later age."

We found that under physiological conditions IDE is secreted at high levels from the microglial cells, and degrades Abeta extracellularly [73]. Purified IDE from rat liver and brain was shown to degrade Abeta effectively. IDE is present in the soluble fractions from human brains, and binds and degrades Abeta specifically [57] and [71]. Primary cultured neurons were also shown to clear Abeta via extracellular IDE as well as IDE on the cell surface [90]. IDE from brain homogenates degrades different forms of Abeta: Abeta40, Abeta42 and an Abeta mutant in one type of AD (Dutch Variant 1-40 Q) [61] and [71].

SET SupportingText = "Cerebrolysin is a peptide mixture with neurotrophic effects that might reduce the neurodegenerative pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cerebrolysin might reduce amyloid deposition by regulating amyloid-beta (Abeta) degradation or by modulating APP expression, maturation, or processing. To investigate these possibilities, APP tg mice were treated for 6 months with Cerebrolysin and analyzed in the water maze, followed by RNA, immunoblot, and confocal microscopy analysis of full-length (FL) APP and its fragments, beta-secretase (BACE1), and Abeta-degrading enzymes [neprilysin (Nep) and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE)]. Consistent with previous studies, Cerebrolysin ameliorated the performance deficits in the spatial learning portion of the water maze and reduced the synaptic pathology and amyloid burden in the brains of APP tg mice. These effects were associated with reduced levels of FL APP and APP C-terminal fragments, but levels of BACE1, Notch1, Nep, and IDE were unchanged. In contrast, levels of active cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (CDK5) and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta [GSK-3beta; but not stress-activated protein kinase-1 (SAPK1)], kinases that phosphorylate APP, were reduced. Furthermore, Cerebrolysin reduced the levels of phosphorylated APP and the accumulation of APP in the neuritic processes. Taken together, these results suggest that Cerebrolysin might reduce AD-like pathology in the APP tg mice by regulating APP maturation and transport to sites where Abeta protein is generated."

SET SupportingText = "Endocytic APP Sorting and ABetaÂ¸ ProductionÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢â¬ï¿½Mutations within the YENPTY endocytosis motif selectively inhibit APP internalization and decrease ABetaÂ¸ generation. This motif and the flanking region serve as the binding site for many cytosolic adaptors with phosphotyrosine-binding domains, including Fe65, Fe65L1, Fe65L2, Mint1 (also called X11a), Mint2, Mint3, Dab1, and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase)-interacting protein family members. Interestingly, Fe65 acts as a functional linker between APP and LRP (another type I membrane protein containing two NPXY endocytosis motifs) in modulating endocytic APP trafficking and ABetaÂ¸ production. A conformational change introduced by phosphorylation at Thr668 (14 amino acids proximal to the YENPTY motif) interferes with Fe65 binding to APP and facilitates BACE1 and gamma-secretase cleavage of APP. Moreover, Fe65 stabilizes the highly labile AICD, which may serve as a regulatory step in modulating the physiological function of AICD (see below). In addition to APP, Mint proteins can directly bind ADP-ribosylation factors; thus, Mint proteins can potentially regulate vesicular trafficking of APP by serving as coat proteins. Finally, the type I transmembrane protein SorLA/LR11 (a member of the VPS10p domain receptor family), which functionally interacts with cytosolic adaptors GGA and PACS-1, attenuates ABetaÂ¸ production by acting as a Golgi/TGN retention factor. SorLA/LR11 is also genetically associated with AD, thus further implicating this sorting molecule in APP biology"

Unlike insulin, metformin exerts no effect on Abeta degradation. In addition, we found that glucose deprivation and various tyrphostins, known inhibitors of insulin-like growth factors/insulin receptor tyrosine kinases, do not modulate the effect of metformin on Abeta. Finally, inhibition of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by the pharmacological inhibitor Compound C largely suppresses metformin's effect on Abeta generation and BACE1 transcription, suggesting an AMPK-dependent mechanism. Although insulin and metformin display opposing effects on Abeta generation, in combined use, metformin enhances insulin's effect in reducing Abeta levels"

However, the surface and the total BACE1 were markedly increased by metformin. Through further subfractionation, using sucrose gradients, we showed that metformin treatment caused changes in the compartmentalization of APP, as evidenced by increased distribution in trans-Golgi network (TGN) vesicles (fraction 2), including those trafficks en route to early endosomes and TGN (fraction 3), and decreased distribution in membranes (fraction 5) (Fig. S1 B and C). BACE1 protein levels were found to be elevated in all 3 fractions: 2, 3, and 5, with an Ã¢â°Ë2-fold increase of the total protein. The increased distribution of both APP and BACE1 in fractions 2 and 3 are expected to favor Abeta generation within TGN and/or endocytic compartments, the two compartments with mild acidic pH optimal for BACE1 activity (33, 34). Indeed, we detected increased immunofluorescent Abeta40 signals after metformin treatment in TGN (Fig. 1E)."

SET SupportingText = "We have previously demonstrated that Leptin reduces extracellular amyloid beta (Abeta) protein both in vitro and in vivo, and intracellular tau phosphorylation in vitro. Further, we have shown that these effects are dependent on activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in vitro. Herein, we investigated downstream effectors of AMPK signaling directly linked to tau phosphorylation. One such target, of relevance to Alzheimer's disease (AD), may be GSK-3beta, which has been shown to be inactivated by Leptin. We therefore dissected the role of GSK-3beta in mediating Leptin's ability to reduce tau phosphorylation in neuronal cells. Our data suggest that Leptin regulates tau phosphorylation through a pathway involving both AMPK and GSK-3beta. This was based on the following: Leptin and the cell-permeable AMPK activator, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxyamide ribonucleoside (AICAR), reduced tau phosphorylation at AD-relevant sites similarly to the GSK-3beta inhibitor, lithium chloride (LiCl). Further, this reduction of tau phosphorylation was mimicked by the downregulation of GSK-3beta, achieved using siRNA technology and antagonized by the ectopic overexpression of GSK-3beta. "

SET SupportingText = "Lysosomal dysfunction may be the earliest histological change in AD. Amyloid plaques are full of active lysosomal hydrolases, implying that plaques may originate from lysosomal rupture. Cathepsins D and E (intracellular aspartyl proteases) are considered to influence Abeta peptides generation within the endosomalÃ¢â¬âlysosomal pathway because they exhibit beta- and gamma-secretase like-activity [32]. For this reason, the endosomalÃ¢â¬âlysosomal pathway is a site for cleavage of the APP into smaller beta-amyloid-containing peptides, which are then degraded by cathepsins. Inhibition of cathepsins activity causes a rapid and pronounced build-up of potentially amyloidogenic protein fragments [33]. On the other hand, a failure to degrade aggregated Abeta_42 in late endosomes or secondary lysosomes was a mechanism that contributed to intracellular accumulation of Abeta in AD. The cysteine protease cathepsin B in lysosomes degrades A peptides, especially the aggregation-prone species Abeta_42."

SET SupportingText = "Experiments in Caenoi-habditis elegans revealed new insights into the role oflR/IGF-IR signaling in A1 -42 toxicÃÂ­ ity, and Ametabolism. Cohen and coworkers could show that knocking down the DAF-2 pathway in C. elegans, which is orthologous to the mammalian insulin and IGF-l signaling cascade, reduces Al31-42 toxicity [35]. Furthermore, this effect was mediated by the two downstream transcripÃÂ­ tion factors, DAF-16 and HSF-l (heat shock transcription factor-!) [132}. DAF-\6 encodes a forkhead transcription factor [133, 134], which translocates into the nucleus [135], and modulates transcription when DAF-2 signaling is abroÃÂ­ gated . The mammalian DAF-16 orthologs are Foxol, 3, and 4 [136). In the mammalian system the IR/IGF-1 R induces phosphorylation of Foxo I and triggers its translocation from the nucleus. The DAF-2 pathway reduces A ,_42 toxicity by two possible mechanisms of detoxification [35]: The first detoxification route leads to disaggregation of the toxic oliÃÂ­ gomer that is positively regulated by HSF-1 and degradation of the amyloidogenic peptides. The second mechanism mediates the formation of low toxic, high molecular weight aggregates from high toxic low molecular weight aggregates, which is positively regulated by DAF-!6. Both detoxificaÃÂ­ tion mechanisms are negatively regulated by DAF-2 signalÃÂ­ ing."

SET SupportingText = "The proposed amyloid-like conformation of peptide/protein hormones in secretory granules may explain the processes of granule formation including hormone selection, membrane surrounding as well as the inert hormone storage, and subsequently the release of hormones from the granules: It is proposed that in the Golgi, amyloid aggregation of the (pro)hormone is initiated spontaneously above a critical (pro)hormone concentration or/and in presence of helper molecules such as GAGs in parallel to a possible prohormone processing. Alternatively, since the prohormone may aggregate less into an amyloid entity than its hormone counterpart, the prohormone processing at critical hormone concentrations may initiate the aggregation. Since the formation of amyloid fibrils is amino acid sequence-specific, the initiated amyloid aggregation of the (pro)hormone is selective yielding granule cores composed of specific hormones only. Specific coaggregation of some hormones may be possible since some amyloid proteins are able to cross-seed. The amyloid aggregation sorts thereby the protein/peptide hormones into secretory granule cores, concentrates them to the highest density possible and excludes non-aggregation-prone constitutively secreted proteins. During the aggregation process the hormone amyloids get surrounded by membrane, separate from the golgi and form mature granules. The membrane attraction may be spontaneous since membrane binding seems to be an inherent property of amyloid aggregates. Alternatively, since the cross-ÃÆÃÂ¸ sheet represents a single structural epitope it may serve as a possible recognition motive of an unknown granule-recruiting membrane protein. Once the secretory granules are formed they can be stored for long durations since the amyloid entity provides a very stable depot. Upon signaling, secretory granules are secreted and the cross-ÃÆÃÂ¸ sheet structure of the amyloid enables a controlled release of monomeric, functional hormone, which might be supported by chaperones."

SET SupportingText = "Rosiglitazone is a TZD derivative that was recently observed to improve cognition in both APP transgenic mice and AD patients [Watson et al., 2005; Pedersen et al., 2006]. It activates PPARgamma leading to increased glucose disposal rates [Jung et al., 2005] and is also neuroprotective against Abeta neurotoxicity [Inestrosa et al., 2005]. Neuroprotection may result through modulation of Wnt signaling since an increase in beta-catenin and inhibition of GSK-3beta is observed upon exposure to rosiglitazone [Inestrosa et al., 2005], although a different study has shown that activation of PPARgamma by a potent ligand leads to beta-catenin degradation [Liu and Farmer 2004]. Nonetheless, in support of the role for PPARgamma activation in neuroprotection, PPARgamma agonists have potent anti-inflammatory effects [Luna-Medina et al., 2005], inhibit microglial activation [Bernardo et al., 2005; Heneka et al., 2005] and have been shown to improve verbal memory in AD patients with T2DM, possibly in a mechanism dependent on PPARgamma activation . A recent report demonstrates that overexpression of PPARgamma in cultured cells leads to a dramatic decrease in the production of Abeta, by increasing the rate of APP degradation via ubiquitination [D'Abramo et al., 2005]. This study also showed that by decreasing Abeta secretion, PPARgamma protects the cells against H2O2-mediated necrosis [D'Abramo et al., 2005]."

Mononuclear phagocytes including monocytes and microglia are the principal cells involved, and they accumulate at perivascular sites of beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition and in senile plaques. Recent evidence suggests that mononuclear phagocyte accumulation in the AD brain is dependent on chemokines. CCL2, a major monocyte chemokine, is upregulated in the AD brain. Interaction of CCL2 with its receptor CCR2 regulates mononuclear phagocyte accumulation in a mouse model of AD. CCR2 deficiency leads to lower mononuclear phagocyte accumulation and is associated with higher brain Abeta levels, specifically around blood vessels, suggesting that monocytes accumulate at sites of Abeta deposition in an initial attempt to clear these deposits and stop or delay their neurotoxic effects.

SET SupportingText = "Cholesterol transport: High cholesterol levels have been linked to overproduction of ABetaÂ¸ and are a risk factor for AD. One of the physiological functions of ABetaÂ¸ has been suggested to control cholesterol transport [167]. Prevalence of AD is reduced among people treated with inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis, statins [168, 169] and animal studies support these results [170]. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that cholesterol modulates APP processing and affects APP mRNA expression [171]. Another mechanism is the increased binding of ABetaÂ¸ to ApoE4 over non-E4 alleles. ApoE is a lipid and cholesterol transport protein responsible for the efflux of cholesterol from neurons to form stable complexes both in vitro and in vivo [172]. Allele ApoE4 is a major risk factor in AD [173]. This relationship might promote synaptogenesis, since in vitro studies have demonstrated that cholesterol released by astroglia increases synaptogenesis [174, 175] with resulting modulation of spike rates [176]. Together, this evidence indicates that one of the physiological functions of APP might be to control cholesterol movement across neuronal membranes [167]."

Using reporter assays, we confirmed that, in human cell cultures, miR-101 significantly reduced the expression of a reporter under control of APP 3'-UTR. Mutation of predicted site 1, but not site 2, eliminated this reporter response. Delivery of miR-101 directly to human HeLa cells significantly reduced APP levels and this effect was eliminated by co-transfection with a miR-101 antisense inhibitor. Delivery of a specific target protector designed to blockade the interaction between miR-101 and its functional target site within APP 3'-UTR enhanced APP levels in HeLa. Therefore, endogenous miR-101 regulates expression of APP in human cells via a specific site located within its 3'-UTR. Finally, we demonstrate that, across a series of human cell lines, highest expression of miR-101 levels was observed in model NT2 neurons."

SET SupportingText = "Seladin-1 was considered a novel neuroprotective factor, because of its anti-apoptotic activity. Subsequently, it was demonstrated that seladin-1 has also enzymatic activity [3-beta-hydroxysterol delta-24-reductase, (DHCR24)], which catalyzes the synthesis of cholesterol from desmosterol. The amount of membrane cholesterol may play an important role both in protecting neuronal cells against toxic insults and in inhibiting the production of beta-amyloid. We demonstrated that seladin-1 overexpression increases the amount of membrane cholesterol and induces resistance against beta-amyloid aggregates in neuroblastoma cells, whereas a specific inhibitor of DHCR24 increased cell vulnerability. We also hypothesized that seladin-1 might be a mediator of the neuroprotective effects of estrogens. We first demonstrated that, in human fetal neuroepithelial cells (FNC), 17beta-estradiol, raloxifene, and tamoxifen exert protective effects against beta-amyloid toxicity and oxidative stress. In addition, these molecules significantly increased the expression of seladin-1 and the amount of cell cholesterol. Then, we showed that, upon seladin-1 silencing, the protective effects of estrogens were abolished, thus indicating this factor as a fundamental mediator of estrogen-mediated neuroprotection, at least in FNC cells. Furthermore, we detected the presence of functionally active half-palindromic estrogen responsive elements upstream the coding region of the seladin-1 gene. Overall, our results indicate that seladin-1 may be viewed as a multi-faceted protein, which conjugates both the neuroprotective properties of estrogens and the important functions of cholesterol in maintaining brain homeostasis"

Serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) is the first rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo ceramide synthesis. However, the regulation of SPT is not yet understood. Evidence suggests that it may be posttranscriptionally regulated. Therefore, we investigated the role of miRNAs in the regulation of SPT and amyloid beta (Abeta) generation. We show that SPT is upregulated in a subgroup of sporadic AD patient brains. This is further confirmed in mouse model studies of risk factors associated with AD. We identified that the loss of miR-137, -181c, -9, and 29a/b-1 increases SPT and in turn Abeta levels, and provides a mechanism for the elevated risk of AD associated with age, high-saturated-fat diet, and gender.

SET SupportingText = "Background and Objective: Could a normal - but persistent - stress response to impeded axonal transport lead to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD)? Our results offer an affirmative answer, suggesting a mechanism for the abnormal production of amyloid-beta (Abeta), triggered by the slowed axonal transport at old age. We hypothesize that Abeta precursor protein (APP) is a sensor at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that detects, and signals to the nucleus, abnormalities in axonal transport. When persistently activated, due to chronically slowed-down transport, this signaling pathway leads to accumulation of Abeta within the ER. Methods and Results: We tested this hypothesis with the neuronal cell line CAD. We show that, normally, a fraction of APP is transported into neurites by recruiting kinesin-1 via the adaptor protein, Fe65. Under conditions that block kinesin-1-dependent transport, APP, Fe65 and kinesin-1 accumulate in the soma, and form a complex at the ER. This complex recruits active c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which phosphorylates APP at Thr(668). This phosphorylation increases the cleavage of APP by the amyloidogenic pathway, which generates Abeta within the ER lumen, and releases Fe65 into the cytoplasm. Part of the released Fe65 translocates into the nucleus, likely to initiate a gene transcription response to arrested transport. Prolonged arrest of kinesin-1-dependent transport could thus lead to accumulation and oligomerization of Abeta in the ER. Conclusion: These results support a model where the APP:Fe65 complex is a sensor at the ER for detecting the increased level of kinesin-1 caused by halted transport, which signals to the nucleus, while concomitantly generating an oligomerization-prone pool of Abeta in the ER. Our hypothesis could thus explain a pathogenic mechanism in AD."

SET SupportingText = "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) is a protective mechanism against ER stress in which unfolded proteins accumulated in the ER are selectively transported to the cytosol for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. We cloned the novel ubiquitin ligase HRD1, which is involved in ERAD, and showed that HRD1 promoted amyloid precursor protein (APP) ubiquitination and degradation, resulting in decreased generation of amyloid Abeta (Abeta). In addition, suppression of HRD1 expression caused APP accumulation and promoted Abeta generation associated with ER stress and apoptotic process. Interestingly, HRD1 levels were significantly decreased in the cerebral cortex of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the brains of these patients experienced ER stress. Our recent study revealed that this decrease in HRD1 was due to its insolubilization; however, controversy persists about whether the decrease in HRD1 protein promotes Abeta generation or whether Abeta neurotoxicity causes the decrease in HRD1 protein levels. Here, we review current findings on the mechanism of HRD1 protein loss in the AD brain and the involvement of HRD1 in the pathogenesis of AD. Furthermore, we propose that HRD1 may be a target for novel AD therapeutics."

SET SupportingText = "gene mutation of presenilin, which is a component of the gamma-secretase complex and is associated with familial AD, results in an attenuation of ER chaperone expression during ER stress. Mutations in presenilin inhibit activation of IRE1, ATF6, and PERK, all of which act as signal transducers of ER stress in the ER membrane (for details, see the article by Hosoi and Ozawa in this Forum Minireview series: Ref. 14), thereby making neurons vulnerable to ER stress. In addition, nitric oxideÃ¢â¬âinduced S-nitrosylation of ER chaperone protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) inhibits its enzymatic activity, leading to ER stressÃ¢â¬âinduced neuronal death. Interestingly, S-nitrosylation of PDI has been observed in the brain of sporadic AD and PD patients. ER stress can also cause AD onset. For example, eIF2a phosphorylation, which is induced by eIF2a kinase PERK, elevates BACE1 (Abeta-secretase) levels and causes increased Abeta production (17). Furthermore, Abeta has been reported to induce ER stress, leading to activation of ER stressÃ¢â¬âspecific initiator caspases, including mouse caspase- 12 and human caspase-4. In conclusion, because postmortem AD patient brain samples exhibit activated UPR markers, including phosphorylated PERK, eIF2a, and IRE1, ER stress probably plays a key role in AD pathogenesis as a cause or consequence"

Defects in axonal transport are an early pathological feature in Alzheimer's disease and defective APP transport is known to increase Abeta production. We show that calsyntenin-1 and APP are co-transported through axons and that siRNA-induced loss of calsyntenin-1 markedly disrupts axonal transport of APP. Thus, perturbation to axonal transport of APP on calsyntenin-1 containing carriers induces alterations to APP processing that increase production of Abeta. Together, our findings suggest that disruption of calsyntenin-1-associated axonal transport of APP is a pathogenic mechanism in Alzheimer's disease."

In this study, we investigated rescuing effect of CysLT1R antagonist montelukast on Abeta1-42-induced neurotoxicity in primary neurons. Our data showed that Abeta1-42 elicited a marked increase of CysLT1R expression in primary mouse neurons. This increment of CysLT1R expression was accompanied by increases of inflammatory factors such as NF-ÃÂºB p65, tumor necrosis factor-ÃÂ± (TNFÃÂ±) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) as well as pro-apoptotic protein Caspase-3 activation and anti-apoptotic process protein Bcl-2 reduction. This observation was confirmed with treatment of montelukast, a selective CysLT1R antagonist, which had significant effect on Abeta1-42-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, blockade of CysLT1R with montelukast reversed Abeta1-42-mediated increase of CysLT1R expression, and concomitant changes of the pro-inflammatory factors and the apoptotic process-related proteins. The results demonstrate that montelukast rescued neurons against Abeta1-42-induced neurotoxicity, neuroinflammation and apoptosis by down-regulating CysLT1R-mediated NF-ÃÂºB signaling, suggesting that CysLT1R may be a potential target for AD, and its antagonist may have beneficial effects for treatment of AD."
