SET SupportingText = "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic disorder that slowly destroys neurons and causes serious cognitive disability. AD is associated with senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Amyloid-beta (Abeta), a major component of senile plaques, has various pathological effects on cell and organelle function. The extracellular Abeta oligomers may activate caspases through activation of cell surface death receptors. Alternatively, intracellular Abeta may contribute to pathology by facilitating tau hyper-phosphorylation, disrupting mitochondria function, and triggering calcium dysfunction. To date genetic studies have revealed four genes that may be linked to autosomal dominant or familial early onset AD (FAD). These four genes include: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). All mutations associated with APP and PS proteins can lead to an increase in the production of Abeta peptides, specfically the more amyloidogenic form, Abeta42. FAD-linked PS1 mutation downregulates the unfolded protein response and leads to vulnerability to ER stress."

An overactivity of the cyclin-dependent protein kinase CDK5 in the brain has been implicated in neuronal degeneration and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles due to hyperphosphorylation of essential neuronal proteins such as MAP and Tau (2). CDK5 is regulated by the neuron-specific and cyclin-related protein p35 (also known as p35Ncdk5a). During the development of Alzheimer's disease, p35 is processed to a smaller protein, p25, which is a constitutive activator of CDK5. The generation of p25 disrupts CDK5 localization and substrate preferences (2). In addition, the expression of p25 in neurons results in a collapse of microtubules, neurite retraction, and apoptosis (2)."

In this context, we observed that GSK3beta inhibitors such as lithium chloride and 6-bromoindirubin-3'-monoxime (6-BIO) reversed those phosphorylation events and protected neurons. These data suggest that GSK3beta may still have its kinase activity despite increase of its phosphorylation at serine-9 in AD brains at least in PP2A-compromised conditions and that GSK3beta inhibitors could be a valuable drug candidate in AD."

Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5), another kinase involved in tau phosphorylation [190], is indirectly activated by the calcium-activated protease calpain. Indeed, cdk5 has to be associated with its regulatory subunit, p35 to be activated. Conversion of p35 to p25 deregulates cdk5 activity, resulting in an increased cdk5 kinase activity [191]. Calpain cleaves p35 into p25, and thus controls cdk5 activation [192]. Furthermore, tau is dephosphorylated by the calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin [193]. Calpain was also proposed to directly participate in tau proteolysis and degradation"

SET SupportingText = "We have previously demonstrated that Leptin reduces extracellular amyloid beta (Abeta) protein both in vitro and in vivo, and intracellular tau phosphorylation in vitro. Further, we have shown that these effects are dependent on activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in vitro. Herein, we investigated downstream effectors of AMPK signaling directly linked to tau phosphorylation. One such target, of relevance to Alzheimer's disease (AD), may be GSK-3beta, which has been shown to be inactivated by Leptin. We therefore dissected the role of GSK-3beta in mediating Leptin's ability to reduce tau phosphorylation in neuronal cells. Our data suggest that Leptin regulates tau phosphorylation through a pathway involving both AMPK and GSK-3beta. This was based on the following: Leptin and the cell-permeable AMPK activator, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxyamide ribonucleoside (AICAR), reduced tau phosphorylation at AD-relevant sites similarly to the GSK-3beta inhibitor, lithium chloride (LiCl). Further, this reduction of tau phosphorylation was mimicked by the downregulation of GSK-3beta, achieved using siRNA technology and antagonized by the ectopic overexpression of GSK-3beta. "

SET SupportingText = "The PI3K/Akt signaling: PI3K, a membrane-associated second messenger protein, and its downstream kinase, Akt, are associated with neuronal survival [111] and plasticity [112] via activation of transcription pathways and protein synthesis. PI3K pathway, which required the activation of IGF-1/insulin receptors, is the most convincing prosurvival effect of ABetaÂ¸42 monomers. The PI3K signaling pathway is important in the transmission of survival signals in many cell types including neurons [113, 114]. The PI3K-Akt signaling cascade, initiated by IRS, is phosphorylated by stimulated insulin- andIGF-receptor tyrosine kinases [115]. One of the kinases known to lie downstream of PI3K is Akt, which can be directly activated by products of PI3K [116] by promoting its phosphorylation at Ser473 and Thr308 [117]. Activated Akt, in turn, phosphorylates a wide range of substrates activating anti-apoptotic (survival) factors and inactivating pro-apoptotic factors [114, 117]. Certain proapoptotic mediators, such as the transcription factor forkhead (FOXO), the tau kinase GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸, and the Bcl2 antagonist BAD proteins, are inactivated by Akt [118, 119]. Akt downregulates the activities of GSK-3a and GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸ by phosphorylating the former at Ser21 and the latter at Ser9 [118]. Phosphorylation/inactivation of GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸, suppresses GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸-dependent phosphorylation of tau at residues overphosphorylated in AD and prevents apoptosis of confluent cells. Treatment of cortical neurons with ABetaÂ¸42 monomers increased Ser9 phosphorylation (inhibition) of the Akt substrate, GSK- 3ÃÆÃÂ¸ [97]. Inhibition of GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸ promotes cell survival through a variety of mechanisms including a reduced degradation of ÃÆÃÂ¸-catenin, which then translocates into the nucleus and activates the transcription of protective genes [126]."

The correlation of these markers with clinical parameters was also evaluated. The levels of p-tau were higher in AD compared to controls, while the tau/p-tau ratio was decreased. The expression of CCL2 was increased in AD. A positive correlation was observed between BA levels and all chemokines studied, and between CCL2 and p-tau levels. Our results suggest that levels of CCL2 in CSF are involved in the pathogenesis of AD and it may be an additional useful biomarker for monitoring disease progression."

SET SupportingText = "In this in vitro study, we found that: (a) alpha-SN directly stimulates the phosphorylation of tau by glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), (b) alpha-SN forms a heterotrimeric complex with tau and GSK-3beta, and (c) the nonamyloid beta component (NAC) domain and an acidic region of alpha-SN are responsible for the stimulation of GSK-3beta-mediated tau phosphorylation. Thus, it is concluded that alpha-SN functions as a connecting mediator for tau and GSK-3beta, resulting in GSK-3beta-mediated tau phosphorylation. Because the expression of alpha-SN is promoted by oxidative stress, the accumulation of alpha-SN induced by such stress may directly induce the hyperphosphorylation of tau by GSK-3beta. Furthermore, we found that heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) suppresses the alpha-SN-induced phosphorylation of tau by GSK-3beta through its direct binding to alpha-SN, suggesting that Hsp70 acts as a physiological suppressor of alpha-SN-mediated tau hyperphosphorylation."

Although Dyrk1A is involved in the control of cell growth and postembryonic neurogenesis, its potential role during cell death and signaling pathway is not clearly understood. In the present study, we show that Dyrk1A is activated under the condition of apoptotic cell death. In addition, Dyrk1A is coupled to JNK1 activation, and directly interacts with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1). Moreover, Dyrk1A positively regulates ASK1-mediated JNK1-signaling, and appears to directly phosphorylate ASK1. These data indicate that Dyrk1A regulates cell death through facilitating ASK1-mediated signaling events."

Recently, many studies implicated a potential role of Dyrk1A during cell death. For example, Dyrk1A caused the formation of abnormal protein aggregates through the phosphorylation of a-synuclein, APP, and tau. Furthermore, these cells show a marked increase of apoptotic cell death (Park et al., 2007), indicating that the overexpression of Dyrk1A induces cell death"

SET SupportingText = "AMPK activity decreases in AD brain, indicating decreased mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Emerging evidence demonstrates that AMPK activation is a potential target for improving perturbed brain energy metabolism that is involved in the pathogenesis of AD. The roles of AMPK in the pathogenesis of AD include Abeta-amyloid protein (Abeta) generation and tau phosphorylation. In particular, AMPK may regulate Abeta generation through modulating neuronal cholesterol and sphingomyelin levels and through regulating APP distribution in the lipid rafts. AMPK is activated by phosphorylation of Thr-172 by LKB1 complex in response to increase in the AMP/ATP ratio and by calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-beta in response to elevated Ca(2+) levels, which contributes to regulating Abeta generation. AMPK is a physiological tau kinase and can increase the phosphorylation of tau at Ser-262. AMPK can also directly phosphorylate tau at Thr-231 and Ser-396/404. Furthermore, AMPK activation decreases mTOR signaling activity to facilitate autophagy and promotes lysosomal degradation of Abeta. However, AMPK activation has non-neuroprotective property and may lead to detrimental outcomes, including Abeta generation and tau phosphorylation. Therefore, it is still unclear whether AMPK could serve a potential therapeutic target for AD, and hence, further studies will be needed to clarify the role of AMPK in AD."

ShcA (or ShcC) adaptors connect growth factor receptors to specific signaling pathways (typically Ras/ERK1/2 pathway but also PI3K/Akt signalling) and are involved in cell proliferation differentiation and apoptotic process and neuronal development. Also the role of Grb2 in Ras-signaling pathway is well known as well as its involvement in the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways cascade.

SET SupportingText = "Abnormal regulation of tau phosphorylation and/or alternative splicing is associated with the development of a large (>20) group of neurodegenerative disorders collectively known as tauopathies, the most common being Alzheimer's disease. Despite intensive research, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that participate in the transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of endogenous tau, especially in neurons. We identified miR-16 and miR-132 as putative endogenous modulators of neuronal tau phosphorylation and tau exon 10 splicing, respectively. Interestingly, these miRNAs have been implicated in cell survival and function, whereas changes in miR-16/132 levels correlate with tau pathology in human neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, understanding how miRNA networks influence tau metabolism and possibly other biological systems might provide important clues into the molecular causes of tauopathies, particularly the more common but less understood sporadic forms."

SET SupportingText = "Alzheimer disease, the most common tauopathy, is characterized by neurofibrillary tangles that are mainly composed of abnormally phosphorylated Tau. Tau phosphorylation occurs mainly at proline-directed Ser/Thr sites, which are targeted by protein kinases such as GSK3beta and Cdk5. We reported previously that dephosphorylation of Tau at Cdk5-mediated sites was enhanced by Pin1, a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase that stimulates dephosphorylation at proline-directed sites by protein phosphatase 2A. Pin1 deficiency is suggested to cause Tau hyperphosphorylation in Alzheimer disease. Up to the present, Pin1 binding was only shown for two Tau phosphorylation sites (Thr-212 and Thr-231) despite the presence of many more hyperphosphorylated sites. Here, we analyzed the interaction of Pin1 with Tau phosphorylated by Cdk5-p25 using a GST pulldown assay and Biacore approach. We found that Pin1 binds and stimulates dephosphorylation of Tau at all Cdk5-mediated sites (Ser-202, Thr-205, Ser-235, and Ser-404). Furthermore, FTDP-17 mutant Tau (P301L or R406W) showed slightly weaker Pin1 binding than non-mutated Tau, suggesting that FTDP-17 mutations induce hyperphosphorylation by reducing the interaction between Pin1 and Tau."

Further research by Freude et al. [15] has linked hy-perinsulinemia to tau hyperphosphorylation which is an imÃÂ­ portant component in the process underlying AD pathology. Schubert eta!.

We have purified a novel Cdc2-like kinase from bovine brain capable of phosphorylating both the neurofilament proteins and tau. The purified enzyme is a heterodimer of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) and a novel regulatory subunit, p25. When overexpressed and purified from Escherichia coli, p25 can activate Cdk5 in vitro. Unlike Cdk5, which is ubiquitously expressed in human tissue, the p25 transcript is expressed only in brain. A full-length complementary DNA clone showed that p25 is a truncated form of a larger protein precursor, p35, which seems to be the predominant form of the protein in crude brain extract. Cdk5/p35 is the first example of a Cdc2-like kinase with neuronal function."
