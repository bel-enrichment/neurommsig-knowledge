We reported previously that dephosphorylation of Tau at Cdk5-mediated sites was enhanced by Pin1, a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase that stimulates dephosphorylation at proline-directed sites by protein phosphatase 2A. Pin1 deficiency is suggested to cause Tau hyperphosphorylation in Alzheimer disease. Up to the present, Pin1 binding was only shown for two Tau phosphorylation sites (Thr-212 and Thr-231) despite the presence of many more hyperphosphorylated sites. Here, we analyzed the interaction of Pin1 with Tau phosphorylated by Cdk5-p25 using a GST pulldown assay and Biacore approach. We found that Pin1 binds and stimulates dephosphorylation of Tau at all Cdk5-mediated sites (Ser-202, Thr-205, Ser-235, and Ser-404).

The PI3K pathway as well as the RAS-RAF-MAPK cascade regulate different transcription factors involved in transcriptional regulation of metabolism and clearance of ÃÂ­ amyloid.

PI3K pathway, which required the activation of IGF-1/insulin receptors, is the most convincing prosurvival effect of ABetaÂ¸42 monomers. The PI3K signaling pathway is important in the transmission of survival signals in many cell types including neurons [113, 114]. The PI3K-Akt signaling cascade, initiated by IRS, is phosphorylated by stimulated insulin- andIGF-receptor tyrosine kinases [115]. One of the kinases known to lie downstream of PI3K is Akt, which can be directly activated by products of PI3K [116] by promoting its phosphorylation at Ser473 and Thr308 [117]. Activated Akt, in turn, phosphorylates a wide range of substrates activating anti-apoptotic (survival) factors and inactivating pro-apoptotic factors [114, 117]. Certain proapoptotic mediators, such as the transcription factor forkhead (FOXO), the tau kinase GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸, and the Bcl2 antagonist BAD proteins, are inactivated by Akt [118, 119]. Akt downregulates the activities of GSK-3a and GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸ by phosphorylating the former at Ser21 and the latter at Ser9 [118]. Phosphorylation/inactivation of GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸, suppresses GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸-dependent phosphorylation of tau at residues overphosphorylated in AD and prevents apoptosis of confluent cells. Treatment of cortical neurons with ABetaÂ¸42 monomers increased Ser9 phosphorylation (inhibition) of the Akt substrate, GSK- 3ÃÆÃÂ¸ [97]. Inhibition of GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸ promotes cell survival through a variety of mechanisms including a reduced degradation of ÃÆÃÂ¸-catenin, which then translocates into the nucleus and activates the transcription of protective genes [126].", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "reference": "20847424"}, "annotations": {"Subgraph": {"GSK3 subgraph": true, "Tau protein subgraph": true}, "Confidence": {"High": true}}, "subject": {"modifier": "Activity"}, "source": 145, "target": 50, "key": "e18b238ebe398b923078862b2b169bd6380703b2245acefe4dec2870f14c6624cbd3ec45c5f4543bb3c2c15cf9f6eb0c40cad8a806275588682886f43d281bb9"}, {"line": 39218, "relation": "decreases", "evidence": "In the present review, we discuss our initial in vitro results and additional investigations showing that Abeta activates GSK-3beta through impairment of phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI3)/Akt signaling; that Abeta-activated GSK-3beta induces hyperphosphorylation of tau, NFT formation, neuronal death, and synaptic loss (all found in the AD brain); that GSK-3beta can induce memory deficits in vivo; and that inhibition of GSK-3alpha (an isoform of GSK-3beta) reduces Abeta production.", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "name": "J Alzheimers Dis2006", "reference": "16914869"}, "annotations": {"Confidence": {"High": true}, "Subgraph": {"GSK3 subgraph": true, "Tau protein subgraph": true, "Amyloidogenic subgraph": true}}, "source": 145, "target": 66, "key": "2aae94141ec7578eeb5751036f8ca154314ce54d9498b986c2377f999aebfc38358064a652918500d11948f215e8019b3319e9a106f3de642b683c787c1c1551"}, {"line": 17077, "relation": "association", "evidence": "Glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) is recognized as one of major kinases to phosphorylate tau in Alzheimer's disease (AD), thus lots of AD drug discoveries target GSK3beta.

Emerging evidence demonstrates that AMPK activation is a potential target for improving perturbed brain energy metabolism that is involved in the pathogenesis of AD. The roles of AMPK in the pathogenesis of AD include Abeta-amyloid protein (Abeta) generation and tau phosphorylation. In particular, AMPK may regulate Abeta generation through modulating neuronal cholesterol and sphingomyelin levels and through regulating APP distribution in the lipid rafts. AMPK is activated by phosphorylation of Thr-172 by LKB1 complex in response to increase in the AMP/ATP ratio and by calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-beta in response to elevated Ca(2+) levels, which contributes to regulating Abeta generation. AMPK is a physiological tau kinase and can increase the phosphorylation of tau at Ser-262. AMPK can also directly phosphorylate tau at Thr-231 and Ser-396/404.

Pin1 deficiency is suggested to cause Tau hyperphosphorylation in Alzheimer disease. Up to the present, Pin1 binding was only shown for two Tau phosphorylation sites (Thr-212 and Thr-231) despite the presence of many more hyperphosphorylated sites. Here, we analyzed the interaction of Pin1 with Tau phosphorylated by Cdk5-p25 using a GST pulldown assay and Biacore approach. We found that Pin1 binds and stimulates dephosphorylation of Tau at all Cdk5-mediated sites (Ser-202, Thr-205, Ser-235, and Ser-404).

PI3K pathway, which required the activation of IGF-1/insulin receptors, is the most convincing prosurvival effect of ABetaÂ¸42 monomers. The PI3K signaling pathway is important in the transmission of survival signals in many cell types including neurons [113, 114]. The PI3K-Akt signaling cascade, initiated by IRS, is phosphorylated by stimulated insulin- andIGF-receptor tyrosine kinases [115]. One of the kinases known to lie downstream of PI3K is Akt, which can be directly activated by products of PI3K [116] by promoting its phosphorylation at Ser473 and Thr308 [117]. Activated Akt, in turn, phosphorylates a wide range of substrates activating anti-apoptotic (survival) factors and inactivating pro-apoptotic factors [114, 117]. Certain proapoptotic mediators, such as the transcription factor forkhead (FOXO), the tau kinase GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸, and the Bcl2 antagonist BAD proteins, are inactivated by Akt [118, 119]. Akt downregulates the activities of GSK-3a and GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸ by phosphorylating the former at Ser21 and the latter at Ser9 [118]. Phosphorylation/inactivation of GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸, suppresses GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸-dependent phosphorylation of tau at residues overphosphorylated in AD and prevents apoptosis of confluent cells. Treatment of cortical neurons with ABetaÂ¸42 monomers increased Ser9 phosphorylation (inhibition) of the Akt substrate, GSK- 3ÃÆÃÂ¸ [97]. Inhibition of GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸ promotes cell survival through a variety of mechanisms including a reduced degradation of ÃÆÃÂ¸-catenin, which then translocates into the nucleus and activates the transcription of protective genes [126].", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "reference": "20847424"}, "annotations": {"Subgraph": {"GSK3 subgraph": true, "Tau protein subgraph": true}, "Confidence": {"High": true}}, "object": {"modifier": "Activity"}, "source": 50, "target": 145, "key": "a768e4c190454a1df264e6e2c9b556ad2b59b65ff9f479f794949fba706d6e67004614512bca0da94f461c2c9d0f70b86adcdec7d20982feb0d99933cd338813"}, {"line": 5535, "relation": "association", "evidence": "In healthy neurons the axon contains relatively high amounts of microtubules which are stabilized by the protein tau.

It is worth noting that ERK1/2 activity is increased in AD brains and that activated MAPKs have been involved in the abnormal hyperphosphorylation of Tau in AD", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "reference": "22496686"}, "annotations": {"Confidence": {"High": true}, "Subgraph": {"Tau protein subgraph": true, "MAPK-ERK subgraph": true}, "MeSHDisease": {"Alzheimer Disease": true}}, "subject": {"modifier": "Activity"}, "source": 240, "target": 166, "key": "c89913f3db56ec485b6429cb1798c992fd2a0538b09152e790c64bb1197605d10a599d5b2ae2bd8101c5cb84c5c005d438fd91cda1a84afd21e9493f54abce86"}, {"line": 42055, "relation": "increases", "evidence": "The pathogenic correlation between Shc/Grb2 binding to AbetaPP during AD development is supported by the observation that the complexes AbetaPP (or CTFs)/ShcA or Grb2 are significantly increased in AD brain as compared to controls [55].

These data give prominence to the biological importance of AbetaPP phosphorylation for its functions and the regulation of intracellular adaptor binding as events responsible for the induction of glial-associated mitogenic pathway. Furthermore, ERK1/2, activated by Abeta in vitro, plays a role in AbetaPP processing and phosphorylates Tau in a PHF-Tau similar manner.
