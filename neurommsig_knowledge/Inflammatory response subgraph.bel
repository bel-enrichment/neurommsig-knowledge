This is consistent with the finding that miR-659 binding to the high risk T allele of rs5848 may augment translational inhibition of GRN and alter risk of FTD and possibly other dementias."

SET SupportingText = "Neuroinflammation is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and microglia, the brain's resident phagocyte, are pivotal for the immune response observed in AD. Microglia act as sentinel and protective cells, but may become inappropriately reactive in AD to drive neuropathology. Recent Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have identified more than 20 gene variants associated with an increased risk of late-onset AD (LOAD), the most prevalent form of AD [1]. The findings strongly implicate genes related to the immune response (CR1, CD33, MS4A1, CLU, ABCA7, EPHA1), endocytosis (BIN1, PICALM, CD2AP, EPHA1 and SORL1) and lipid biology (CLU, ABCA7 and SORL1) [2-8], and many encode proteins which are highly expressed in microglia [1]. Furthermore, recent identification of a low frequency mutation in the gene encoding the triggering receptor expressed in myeloid cells 2 protein (TREM2) confers increased risk of AD in LOAD cohorts with an effect size similar to that for APOE, until recently the only identified genetic risk factor associated with LOAD [9,10(ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬ÃÂ¢)] (Figure 1). The present review summarises our current understanding of the probable roles of microglial genes in the regulation of neuroinflammatory processes in AD and their relation to other processes affecting the disease's progression."

SET SupportingText = "The amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) because APP is processed into the beta-peptide that accumulates in amyloid plaques, and APP gene mutations can cause early onset AD. Inflammation is also associated with AD as exemplified by increased expression of interleukin-1 (IL-1) in microglia in affected areas of the AD brain. Here we demonstrate that IL-1alpha and IL-1beta increase APP synthesis by up to 6-fold in primary human astrocytes and by 15-fold in human astrocytoma cells without changing the steady-state levels of APP mRNA. A 90-nucleotide sequence in the APP gene 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) conferred translational regulation by IL-1alpha and IL-1beta to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. Steady-state levels of transfected APP(5'-UTR)/CAT mRNAs were unchanged, whereas both base-line and IL-1-dependent CAT protein synthesis were increased. This APP mRNA translational enhancer maps from +55 to +144 nucleotides from the 5'-cap site and is homologous to related translational control elements in the 5'-UTR of the light and and heavy ferritin genes. Enhanced translation of APP mRNA provides a mechanism by which IL-1 influences the pathogenesis of AD."

We show that both dipyridamole and compounds which increase cGMP levels prevent Abeta-induced microglial inflammation. Our results suggest that therapeutic intervention aimed at reduction of microglial-mediated inflammation via inhibition of cGMP-PDE or elevation of cGMP may be beneficial in the treatment of AD."

SET SupportingText = "Cell Adhesion An RHDS motif near the extralumenal portion of APP or at the C terminus of APPs lying within the ABetaÂ¸ region appears to promote cell adhesion. It is believed that this region acts in an integrin-like manner and can, accordingly, be blocked by RGDS peptide sequence derived from the fibronectin-binding domain. Similarly, APP colocalizes with integrins on the surface of axons and at sites of adhesion. Evidence of interaction with laminin and collagen provides further evidence of adhesion-promoting properties. Interestingly, because the RHDS sequence is contained within the N terminus of ABetaÂ¸, similar cell adhesion-promoting properties have also been attributed to the ABetaÂ¸ peptide itself. This latter property is, however, difficult to tease out in view of the cytotoxicity of ABetaÂ¸ peptide when tested in a variety of cell systems in vitro. Furthermore, it is difficult to separate the cell adhesion-from the neurite outgrowth-promoting roles of APP. Clearly, these are probably somewhat inseparable, as neuronal migration, neurite outgrowth, and even synaptogenesis would involve substrate adhesion."

Quantitative studies showed a significant decrease in CD200 protein and mRNA in AD hippocampus and inferior temporal gyrus, but not cerebellum. Immunohistochemistry of brain tissue sections of hippocampus, superior frontal gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus and cerebellum from AD and non-demented cases demonstrated a predominant, though heterogeneous, neuronal localization for CD200. Decreased neuronal expression was apparent in brain regions affected by AD pathology. There was also a significant decrease in CD200R mRNA expression in AD hippocampus and inferior temporal gyrus, but not cerebellum. Low expression of CD200R by microglia was confirmed at the mRNA and protein level using cultured human microglia compared to blood-derived macrophages. Treatment of microglia and macrophages with interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 significantly increased expression of CD200R. Expression of these cytokines was not generally detectable in brain. These data indicate that the anti-inflammatory CD200/CD200R system may be deficient in AD brains"

In concert with this protection, there is an upregulation of neurotrophins [i.e., nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)]. Furthermore, blocking exogenous NGF or BDNF by binding it to antibody prevents tarenflurbil from protecting human neuronal cells from Abeta_{42} and H_{2}O_{2} cytotoxicity.

Therefore, the mechanism responsible for increase in cathepsin D activity might be an effect of increased synthesis regulated by p53.

SET SupportingText = "Rosiglitazone is a TZD derivative that was recently observed to improve cognition in both APP transgenic mice and AD patients [Watson et al., 2005; Pedersen et al., 2006]. It activates PPARgamma leading to increased glucose disposal rates [Jung et al., 2005] and is also neuroprotective against Abeta neurotoxicity [Inestrosa et al., 2005]. Neuroprotection may result through modulation of Wnt signaling since an increase in beta-catenin and inhibition of GSK-3beta is observed upon exposure to rosiglitazone [Inestrosa et al., 2005], although a different study has shown that activation of PPARgamma by a potent ligand leads to beta-catenin degradation [Liu and Farmer 2004]. Nonetheless, in support of the role for PPARgamma activation in neuroprotection, PPARgamma agonists have potent anti-inflammatory effects [Luna-Medina et al., 2005], inhibit microglial activation [Bernardo et al., 2005; Heneka et al., 2005] and have been shown to improve verbal memory in AD patients with T2DM, possibly in a mechanism dependent on PPARgamma activation . A recent report demonstrates that overexpression of PPARgamma in cultured cells leads to a dramatic decrease in the production of Abeta, by increasing the rate of APP degradation via ubiquitination [D'Abramo et al., 2005]. This study also showed that by decreasing Abeta secretion, PPARgamma protects the cells against H2O2-mediated necrosis [D'Abramo et al., 2005]."

QUIN is likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of several major neuroinflammatory diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The presence of reactive astrocytes, astrogliosis, increased oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines are important pathological hallmarks of AD. We found that QUIN induces IL-1beta expression, a key mediator in AD pathogenesis, in human astrocytes. At pathophysiological concentrations QUIN induced a switch between structural protein expressions in a dose dependent manner, increasing VIM and concomitantly decreasing GFAP expression. Glutamine synthetase (GS) activity was used as a functional metabolic test for astrocytes. We found a significant dose-dependent reduction in GS activity following QUIN treatment. All together, this study showed that QUIN is an important factor for astroglial activation, dysregulation and cell death with potential relevance to AD and other neuroinflammatory diseases."

Upon activation, they adhere to leukocytes and endothelial cells by means of adhesive proteins like P-selectin, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and -2 (ICAM-1 and -2) and secrete inflammatory mediators (chemokines, interleukins). In addition, platelets contain important enzymes involved in inflammatory intermediary synthesis like phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and recent reports demonstrated significant changes in platelet levels and activities in Alzheimer's disease. Thus, as platelets represent an important link between Ass deposition and inflammatory reactions especially at endothelial level, they can be considered a valuable cellular model to evaluate potential peripheral inflammatory biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease."

SET SupportingText = "Granulin (GRN, or progranulin) is a protein involved in wound repair, inflammation, and neoplasia. GRN has also been directly implicated in frontotemporal dementia and may contribute to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. However, GRN regulation expression is poorly understood. A high-throughput experimental microRNA assay showed that GRN is the strongest target for miR-107 in human H4 neuroglioma cells. miR-107 has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, and sequence elements in the open reading frame-rather than the 3' untranslated region-of GRN mRNA are recognized by miR-107 and are highly conserved among vertebrate species. To better understand the mechanism of this interaction, FLAG-tagged Argonaute constructs were used following miR-107 transfection. GRN mRNA interacts preferentially with Argonaute 2. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that regulation of GRN by miR-107 may be functionally important. Glucose supplementation in cultured cells that leads to increased miR-107 levels also results in decreased GRN expression, including changes in cell compartmentation and decreased secretion of GRN protein. This effect was eliminated following miR-107 transfection. We also tested a mouse model where miR-107 has been shown to be down-regulated. In brain tissue subjacent to 1.0 mm depth controlled cortical impact, surviving hippocampal neurons show decreased miR-107 with augmentation of neuronal GRN expression. These findings indicate that miR-107 contributes to GRN expression regulation with implications for brain disorders."

SET SupportingText = "Cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) occurs as a result of the buildup of pathological proteins and downstream events including an elevated and altered inflammatory response. Inflammation has previously been linked to increased abnormal phosphorylation of tau protein.To determine if endogenous amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced neuroinflammation drives tau phosphorylation in vivo, we treated 8-month-old 3xTg-AD with minocycline, an anti-inflammatory agent, to assess how it influenced cognitive decline and development of pathology. 4 months of treatment restored cognition to non-transgenic performance. Inflammatory profiling revealed a marked decrease in GFAP, TNFalpha, and IL6 and an increase in the CXCL1 chemokines KC and MIP1a. Minocycline also reduced levels of insoluble Abeta and soluble fibrils. Despite reducing levels of the tau kinase cdk5 coactivator p25, minocycline did not have wide effects on tau pathology with only one phospho-epitope showing reduction with treatment (S212/S214). The sum of these findings shows that reduction of the inflammatory events in an AD mouse model prevents cognitive deficits associated with pathology, but that endogenous Abeta-derived neuroinflammation does not contribute significantly to the development of tau pathology."

SET SupportingText = "Differential regulation of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1) and IRAK-2 by microRNA-146a and NF-kappaB in stressed human astroglial cells and in Alzheimer disease.In monocytes, increased expression of an NF-ÎºB-regulated miRNA-146a down-regulates expression of the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1), an essential component of Toll-like/IL-1 receptor signaling. Here we extend those observations to the hippocampus and neocortex of Alzheimer disease (AD) brain and to stressed human astroglial (HAG) cells in primary culture. In 66 control and AD samples we note a significant up-regulation of miRNA-146a coupled to down-regulation of IRAK-1 and a compensatory up-regulation of IRAK-2. Using miRNA-146a-, IRAK-1-, or IRAK-2 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs, we observe decreases in IRAK-1 and increases in miRNA-146a and IRAK-2 expression in interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and amyloid-beta-42 (Abeta42) peptide-stressed HAG cells. NF-ÎºB-mediated transcriptional control of human IRAK-2 was localized to between -119 and +12 bp of the immediate IRAK-2 promoter. The NF-ÎºB inhibitors curcumin, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate or CAY10512 abrogated both IRAK-2 and miRNA-146a expression, whereas IRAK-1 was up-regulated. Incubation of a protected antisense miRNA-146a was found to inhibit miRNA-146a and restore IRAK-1, whereas IRAK-2 remained unaffected. These data suggest a significantly independent regulation of IRAK-1 and IRAK-2 in AD and in IL-1beta+Abeta42 peptide-stressed HAG cells and that an inducible, NF-ÎºB-sensitive, miRNA-146a-mediated down-regulation of IRAK-1 coupled to an NF-ÎºB-induced up-regulation of IRAK-2 expression drives an extensively sustained inflammatory response. The interactive signaling of NF-ÎºB and miRNA-146a further illustrate interplay between inducible transcription factors and pro-inflammatory miRNAs that regulate brain IRAK expression. The combinatorial use of NF-ÎºB inhibitors with miRNA-146a or antisense miRNA-146a may have potential as a bi-pronged therapeutic strategy directed against IRAK-2-driven pathogenic signaling."

We employed a lentivirally transduced monocyte cell line (THP1-155) containing an inducible miR-155 transgene to show that endogenous levels of SMAD2 protein were decreased after sustained overexpression of miR-155. This decrease in SMAD2 led to a reduction in both TGF-beta-induced SMAD-2 phosphorylation and SMAD-2-dependent activation of the expression of the CAGA(12)LUC reporter plasmid. Overexpression of miR-155 altered the cellular responses to TGF-beta by changing the expression of a set of genes that is involved in inflammation, fibrosis, and angiogenesis. Our study provides firm evidence of a role for miR-155 in directly repressing SMAD2 expression, and our results demonstrate the relevance of one of the two predicted target sites in SMAD2 3'-UTR. Altogether, our data uncover an important role for miR-155 in modulating the cellular response to TGF-beta with possible implications in several human diseases where homeostasis of TGF-beta might be altered."

The S100B/RAGE-dependent activation of diaphanous-1/Rac1/JNK/AP-1, Ras/Rac1/NF-kB and Src/Ras/PI3K/RhoA/diaphanous-1 results in the up-regulation of expression of the chemokines, CCL3, CCL5, and CXCL12, whose release and activity are required for S100B to stimulate microglia migration.

Up-regulated miRNA-146a targets several inflammation-related and membrane-associated messenger RNAs (mRNAs), including those encoding complement factor-H (CFH) and the interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1), resulting in significant decreases in their expression (p<0.05, ANOVA). In this study we assayed miRNA-146a, CFH, IRAK-1 and tetraspanin-12 (TSPAN12), abundances in primary human neuronal-glial (HNG) co-cultures, in human astroglial (HAG) and microglial (HMG) cells stressed with Abeta42 peptide and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). The results indicate a consistent inverse relationship between miRNA-146a and CFH, IRAK-1 and TSPAN12 expression levels, and indicate that HNG, HAG and HMG cell types each respond differently to Abeta42-peptide+TNFalpha-triggered stress. While the strongest miRNA-146a-IRAK-1 response was found in HAG cells, the largest miRNA-146a-TSPAN12 response was found in HNG cells, and the most significant miRNA-146a-CFH changes were found in HMG cells, the 'resident scavenging macrophages' of the brain."

SET SupportingText = "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with an altered immune response, resulting in chronic increased inflammatory cytokine production with a prominent role of TNF-ÃÂ±. TNF-ÃÂ± signals are mediated by two receptors: TNF  receptor 1 (TNFR1) and TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2). Signaling through TNFR2 is associated with neuroprotection, whereas signaling through TNFR1 is generally proinflammatory and proapoptotic. Here, we have identified a TNF-ÃÂ±-induced proinflammatory agent, lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) via gene array in murine primary cortical neurons. Further investigation showed that Lcn2 protein production and secretion were activated solely upon TNFR1 stimulation when primary murine neurons, astrocytes, and microglia were treated with TNFR1 and TNFR2 agonistic antibodies. Lcn2 was found to be significantly decreased in CSF of human patients with mild cognitive impairment and AD and increased in brain regions associated with AD pathology in human postmortem brain tissue. Mechanistic studies in cultures of primary cortical neurons showed that Lcn2 sensitizes nerve cells to beta-amyloid toxicity. Moreover, Lcn2 silences a TNFR2-mediated protective neuronal signaling cascade in neurons, pivotal for TNF-ÃÂ±-mediated neuroprotection. The present study introduces Lcn2 as a molecular actor in neuroinflammation in early clinical stages of AD."

However, with disease progression, microglia become dysfunctional, release neurotoxins, lose their ability to clear Abeta and produce pro-inflammatory cytokines that promote Abeta production and accumulation. TREM2 has been shown to regulate the phagocytic ability of myeloid cells and their inflammatory response. Here we propose that the mechanism(s) by which TREM2 variants cause Alzheimer's disease are via down regulation of the Abeta phagocytic ability of microglia and by dysregulation of the pro-inflammatory response of these cells. Based on our discussion we propose that TREM2 is a potential therapeutic target for stopping ordelaying progression of AD."

However, inflammatory mediators and the molecular mechanism responsible for / enhanced expression of YKL-40 remained elusive. Using several mouse models of inflammation, we now show that YKL-40 expression correlated with increased expression / of both IL-1 and IL-6. Furthermore, IL-1 together with IL-6 or the IL-6 family cytokine, oncostatin M, synergistically upregulated YKL-40 expression in both / primary human and mouse astrocytes in vitro. The robust cytokine-driven expression of YKL-40 in astrocytes required both STAT3 and NF-kB binding elements of / the YKL-40 promoter. In addition, YKL-40 expression was enhanced by constitutively active STAT3 and inhibited by dominant-negative IkBalpha. Surprisingly, / cytokine-driven expression of YKL-40 in astrocytes was independent of the p65 subunit of NF-kB and instead required subunits RelB and p50. Mechanistically, / we show that IL-1-induced RelB/p50 complex formation was further promoted by oncostatin M and that these complexes directly bound to the YKL-40 promoter. / Moreover, we found that expression of RelB was strongly upregulated during inflammation in vivo and by IL-1 in astrocytes in vitro. We propose that IL-1 and / the IL-6 family of cytokines regulate YKL-40 expression during sterile inflammation via both STAT3 and RelB/p50 complexes.

SET SupportingText = "JAK-STAT signaling as an anti-inflammatory target. JAK-STAT signaling mediates the brain inflammation induced by LPS, IFN-gamma, ganglioside and thrombin. Curcumin activates SH2-containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2), while rosiglitazone and 15d-PGJ2 increase the expressions of SOCS1 and SOCS3. SHP2 and the SOCS proteins are typical negative feedback molecules of the JAK-STAT pathway."
