SET SupportingText = "Amyloid is a term used to describe typically extracellular deposits of aggregated proteins, sometimes known as plaques. Abnormal accumulation of amyloid is Amyloidosis, a term associated with diseased organs and tissues, particularly neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntingdon's. Amyloid deposits consist predominantly of amyloid fibrils, rigid, non-branching structures that form ordered assemblies, characteristically with a cross beta-sheet structure where the sheets run parallel to the direction of the fibril (Sawaya et al. 2007). Often the fibril has a left-handed twist (Nelson & Eisenberg 2006). At least 27 human proteins form amyloid fibrils (Sipe et al. 2010). Many of these proteins have non-pathological functions; the trigger that leads to abnormal aggregations differs between proteins and is not well understood but in many cases the peptides are abnormal fragments or mutant forms arising from polymorphisms, suggesting that the initial event may be aggregation of misfolded or unfolded peptides. Early studies of Amyloid-Beta assembly led to a widely accepted model that assembly was a nucleation-dependent polymerization reaction (Teplow 1998) but it is now understood to be more complex, with multiple 'off-pathway' events leading to a variety of oligomeric structures in addition to fibrils (Roychaudhuri et al. 2008). An increasing body of evidence suggests that these oligomeric forms are primarily responsible for the neurotoxic effects of Amyloid-beta (Roychaudhuri et al. 2008), alpha-synuclein (Winner et al. 2011) and tau (Dance & Strobel 2009, Meraz-Rios et al. 2010). Amyloid oligomers are believed to have a common structural motif that is independent of the protein involved and not present in fibrils (Kayed et al. 2003). Conformation dependent, aggregation specific antibodies suggest that there are 3 general classes of amyloid oligomer structures (Glabe 2009) including annular structures which may be responsible for the widely reported membrane permeabilization effect of amyloid oligomers. Toxicity of amyloid oligomers preceeds the appearance of plaques in mouse models (Ferretti et al. 2011). Fibrils are often associated with other molecules, notably heparan sulfate proteoglycans and Serum Amyloid P-component, which are universally associated and seem to stabilize fibrils, possibly by protecting them from degradation."

SET SupportingText = "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic disorder that slowly destroys neurons and causes serious cognitive disability. AD is associated with senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Amyloid-beta (Abeta), a major component of senile plaques, has various pathological effects on cell and organelle function. The extracellular Abeta oligomers may activate caspases through activation of cell surface death receptors. Alternatively, intracellular Abeta may contribute to pathology by facilitating tau hyper-phosphorylation, disrupting mitochondria function, and triggering calcium dysfunction. To date genetic studies have revealed four genes that may be linked to autosomal dominant or familial early onset AD (FAD). These four genes include: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). All mutations associated with APP and PS proteins can lead to an increase in the production of Abeta peptides, specfically the more amyloidogenic form, Abeta42. FAD-linked PS1 mutation downregulates the unfolded protein response and leads to vulnerability to ER stress."

SET SupportingText = "The amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) because APP is processed into the beta-peptide that accumulates in amyloid plaques, and APP gene mutations can cause early onset AD. Inflammation is also associated with AD as exemplified by increased expression of interleukin-1 (IL-1) in microglia in affected areas of the AD brain. Here we demonstrate that IL-1alpha and IL-1beta increase APP synthesis by up to 6-fold in primary human astrocytes and by 15-fold in human astrocytoma cells without changing the steady-state levels of APP mRNA. A 90-nucleotide sequence in the APP gene 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) conferred translational regulation by IL-1alpha and IL-1beta to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. Steady-state levels of transfected APP(5'-UTR)/CAT mRNAs were unchanged, whereas both base-line and IL-1-dependent CAT protein synthesis were increased. This APP mRNA translational enhancer maps from +55 to +144 nucleotides from the 5'-cap site and is homologous to related translational control elements in the 5'-UTR of the light and and heavy ferritin genes. Enhanced translation of APP mRNA provides a mechanism by which IL-1 influences the pathogenesis of AD."

SET SupportingText = "Although the requirements for binding of Fe65 and X11 to the GYENPTY motif differ slightly, they are sufficiently overlapping to make it conceivable that these proteins compete for binding to APP. Interestingly, opposite effects on APP processing have been observed after co-expression of APP with either Fe65 or X11. Fe65 overexpression increased the amount of cell-surface-associated APP, as well as the processing of APP to APPs and Ab peptide. By contrast, X11 decreased processing and cellular retention of APP. Thus, the functional balance between the two proteins is important for regulation of APP metabolism and possibly APP function. This balance could be further modified by a third protein, mDAB1 (the mammalian homologue of Disabled), that binds to the same region"

The final target for these interactions is ERK1,2, which is activated in mitotic centrosomes in a PS1- and APP-dependent manner.

APP and beta-secretase, both present on cell surface, are endocytosed into endosomes to produce Abeta. The molecular mechanism by which neurons trigger the production of Abeta is poorly understood. We describe here evidence that the binding of lipid-carrying apolipoprotein E (ApoE) to receptor apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2) triggers the endocytosis of APP, beta-secretase, and ApoER2 in neuroblastoma cells, leading to the production of Abeta. This mechanism, mediated by adaptor protein X11alpha or X11beta (X11alpha/beta), whose PTB (phosphotyrosine-binding) domain binds to APP and a newly recognized motif in the cytosolic domain of ApoER2. Isomorphic form ApoE4 triggers the production of more Abeta than by ApoE2 or ApoE3; thus, it may play a role in the genetic risk of ApoE4 for the sporadic AD."

Interestingly, because the RHDS sequence is contained within the N terminus of ABetaÂ¸, similar cell adhesion-promoting properties have also been attributed to the ABetaÂ¸ peptide itself. This latter property is, however, difficult to tease out in view of the cytotoxicity of ABetaÂ¸ peptide when tested in a variety of cell systems in vitro. Furthermore, it is difficult to separate the cell adhesion-from the neurite outgrowth-promoting roles of APP. Clearly, these are probably somewhat inseparable, as neuronal migration, neurite outgrowth, and even synaptogenesis would involve substrate adhesion."

Finally, inhibition of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by the pharmacological inhibitor Compound C largely suppresses metformin's effect on Abeta generation and BACE1 transcription, suggesting an AMPK-dependent mechanism.

However, the surface and the total BACE1 were markedly increased by metformin. Through further subfractionation, using sucrose gradients, we showed that metformin treatment caused changes in the compartmentalization of APP, as evidenced by increased distribution in trans-Golgi network (TGN) vesicles (fraction 2), including those trafficks en route to early endosomes and TGN (fraction 3), and decreased distribution in membranes (fraction 5) (Fig. S1 B and C). BACE1 protein levels were found to be elevated in all 3 fractions: 2, 3, and 5, with an Ã¢â°Ë2-fold increase of the total protein. The increased distribution of both APP and BACE1 in fractions 2 and 3 are expected to favor Abeta generation within TGN and/or endocytic compartments, the two compartments with mild acidic pH optimal for BACE1 activity (33, 34). Indeed, we detected increased immunofluorescent Abeta40 signals after metformin treatment in TGN (Fig. 1E)."

Phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr-172 and its substrate, acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), were found to be both induced by metformin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4 A and B). We also observed a significant inhibition of metformin-stimulated Abeta production by compound C, a specific AMPK inhibitor, in a dose-dependent manner. Compound C inhibited metformin's effect by 50% when used at a concentration (20 ÃÂ¼M) that is known to guarantee its specificity for AMPK (32) (Fig. 4C). These results indicate an AMPK-dependent mechanism for metformin's effect on Abeta. Significantly, the antagonizing effect of compound C was largely attributed to suppression of BACE1 transcription because the mRNA was greatly reduced after treatment with the two drugs (Fig. 4D)."

The permeabilization of the lysosome has been shown to initiate a cell death pathway in specific circumstances. Lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) causes the release of cathepsins and other hydrolases from the lysosomal lumen to the cytosol. LMP is a potentially lethal event because the ectopic presence of lysosomal proteases in the cytosol causes digestion of vital proteins and the activation of additional hydrolases including caspases. This latter process is usually mediated indirectly, through a cascade in which LMP causes the proteolytic activation of Bid (which is cleaved by the two lysosomal cathepsins B and D). The Bid activation then induces mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, resulting in cytochrome c release and apoptosome-dependent caspase activation [19]. However, massive LMP often results in cell death without caspase activation, which may adopt a subapoptotic or necrotic appearance. Moreover, the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bax can translocate from the cytosol to lysosomal membranes and induce LMP"

Amyloid plaques are full of active lysosomal hydrolases, implying that plaques may originate from lysosomal rupture. Cathepsins D and E (intracellular aspartyl proteases) are considered to influence Abeta peptides generation within the endosomalÃ¢â¬âlysosomal pathway because they exhibit beta- and gamma-secretase like-activity [32]. For this reason, the endosomalÃ¢â¬âlysosomal pathway is a site for cleavage of the APP into smaller beta-amyloid-containing peptides, which are then degraded by cathepsins. Inhibition of cathepsins activity causes a rapid and pronounced build-up of potentially amyloidogenic protein fragments [33]. On the other hand, a failure to degrade aggregated Abeta_42 in late endosomes or secondary lysosomes was a mechanism that contributed to intracellular accumulation of Abeta in AD. The cysteine protease cathepsin B in lysosomes degrades A peptides, especially the aggregation-prone species Abeta_42."

Binding of insulin and IGF-1 to their receptors leads to autophosphorylation of the -subunit of the IR/IGF-IR and recruitment of IRS-1 /-2. IRS proteins activate mainly two pathways, the PI3 kinase pathway, and the RAS-RAF-MAP kinase cascade. Tau phosphorylation via IR/IGF-1 signaling is influenced by GSK-3 and the tau phosphatase PP2A. InterÃÂ­ estingly, mTOR signaling couples the activity ofPP2A and GSK-3in a way that the activities of both enzymes change always in the same direction. suggesting that only a dysregulation of either PP2A or GSK-3induces tau hyperphosphorylation. The PI3K pathway as well as the RAS-RAF-MAPK cascade regulate different transcription factors involved in transcriptional regulation of metabolism and clearance of ÃÂ­ amyloid. APP is cleaved by a.-, -secretase (BACE-1) and y-secretase (presenilin). - and subsequent y-cleavage of APP leads to generation of -amyloid 1 -4o/ t-42Ã¢â¬Â¢ IGF-1 signaling promotes a switch lrom TrkA to p75NTR expression leading to increased -secretase activity due to an upregulation of BACE-1 expression.

More recent findings, however, suggest soluble Abeta oligomers may be the cause of memory loss, especially in the early stages of AD, because Abeta oligomers inhibit long-term potentiation in neurons, a well-adopted experimental paradigm for learning and memory (6, 9). Abeta is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by serial proteolytic reactions catalyzed by beta-site of APP cleaving enzyme (BACE) and a multiprotein complex gamma-secretase, in which presenilin is likely the catalytic component "

SET SupportingText = "It is believed that amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, the process of amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage is a key event and has raised much attention in the field of AD research. It is proposed that APP, beta- and gamma-secretases are all located on the lipid raft, and the meeting of them is an indispensable step for Abeta generation. Endocytosis can lead to clustering of APP, beta- and gamma-secretases from separate smaller lipid rafts into a larger one. On the other hand, for myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS), phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) or interaction with Ca(2+) can lead to its release from membrane into cytoplasm. This process induces the release of actins and phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP2), which are important factors for endocytosis. Thus, the present review proposes that MARCKS may be implicated in Abeta generation, by modulating free PIP2 level and actin movement, causing endocytosis"

SET SupportingText = " Transcriptional activation of CREB recruits a multiprotein assembly called a transcriptional co-activator complex. These often include proteins with intrinsic acetyltransferase activity. Among the best characterized transcriptional co-activator proteins is CREB binding protein (CBP). There is no direct evidence indicating how lower levels of Abeta might initiate CREB phosphorylation principally by Ca2+ signaling and/or through PKA/Atk/ERK pathways. However, exceeding physiological levels of Abeta could deregulate Ca2+ signaling mechanism by excessive accumulation of Ca2+ in the cytoplasm and cytoplasmic organelles such as mitochondria. Since hippocampal neuronal calcium is one of the most potent signals in neuronal gene expression [149], Abeta-induced Ca2+ deregulation may lead to compromised synaptic function. Consistence with this hypothesis, AD has been associated with impaired cAMP signaling which may contribute to the pathophysiology of the disease. Levels of the activated (i.e. phosphorylated) form of CREB are reduced in AD compared to that of an age-matched healthy control group [164]. Calcium signaling to the cell nucleus is the key inducer of CREB phosphorylation on its activator site serine 133 [165]. Experiments in aged neurons show altered calcium signaling at the level of either calcium signal generation and/or calcium signal propagation [166]. These studies indicate a critical role of calcium in Abeta-induced synaptic activity and memory formation by regulating specific signal transduction pathways."

ABetaÂ¸42 administered in the low picomolar range activates nAChRs at presynaptic nerve endings of synaptosomes [83, 153]. Under normal conditions, activation of nAChRs is necessary for the ABetaÂ¸-induced increase in synaptic plasticity and memory [23]. However, it remains to be determined whether these effects are mediated by a direct physical interaction of the peptide with the nAChR. In addition, ABetaÂ¸ enhances transmitter release by transient increase of glutamate release from the presynaptic terminal that results from brief periods of high frequency stimulation with Ca2+ buildup within the terminal that triggers mechanisms of short-term synaptic plasticity [154]."

SET SupportingText = "Mitochondrial cyclophilin D: Once inside the mitochondria, Abeta is able to interact with a number of targets, including the mitochondrial proteins ABAD and cyclophilin-D (CypD). Opening the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) to depolarize mitochondria and release cytochrome C may be central to mitochondrial and neuronal malfunction in AD patients. CypD, an integral part of the MPTP, whose opening leads to cell death, interacts with Abeta peptide within the mitochondria of AD patients and a Tg mouse model of AD. MPTP causes mitochondrial swelling, outer membrane rupture, release of cell death mediators and enhances production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Computer simulation studies show that Abeta interacts with both ANT and CypD. CypD/Abeta interaction causes an oxidative stress and increased MPTP opening that triggers neurodegeneration. CypD-deficient cortical mitochondria are resistant to Abeta- and Ca2+-induced mitochondrial swelling and MPTP opening. Adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) is a transport protein for ADP and ATP and component of MPTP that binds directly to CypD. This interaction may facilitate its anchoring in the inner membrane and disturbance of the mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial swelling and cell death. Interestingly, the MPTP also requires the participation of members of the Bcl-2 family proteins but a clear understanding of the interaction of Abeta with CypD together with both proapoptotic or antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins in AD has not been made. The ability of CypD to protect neurons from Abeta- and oxidative stress-induced cell death and its role in improvement of synaptic and cognitive functions has been suggested to provide a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of conditions associated with AD. Together these studies provide new mechanisms for Abeta targets that link the MPTP to synaptic stress and the neurodegeneration seen in AD."

SET SupportingText = "The PI3K/Akt signaling: PI3K, a membrane-associated second messenger protein, and its downstream kinase, Akt, are associated with neuronal survival [111] and plasticity [112] via activation of transcription pathways and protein synthesis. PI3K pathway, which required the activation of IGF-1/insulin receptors, is the most convincing prosurvival effect of ABetaÂ¸42 monomers. The PI3K signaling pathway is important in the transmission of survival signals in many cell types including neurons [113, 114]. The PI3K-Akt signaling cascade, initiated by IRS, is phosphorylated by stimulated insulin- andIGF-receptor tyrosine kinases [115]. One of the kinases known to lie downstream of PI3K is Akt, which can be directly activated by products of PI3K [116] by promoting its phosphorylation at Ser473 and Thr308 [117]. Activated Akt, in turn, phosphorylates a wide range of substrates activating anti-apoptotic (survival) factors and inactivating pro-apoptotic factors [114, 117]. Certain proapoptotic mediators, such as the transcription factor forkhead (FOXO), the tau kinase GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸, and the Bcl2 antagonist BAD proteins, are inactivated by Akt [118, 119]. Akt downregulates the activities of GSK-3a and GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸ by phosphorylating the former at Ser21 and the latter at Ser9 [118]. Phosphorylation/inactivation of GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸, suppresses GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸-dependent phosphorylation of tau at residues overphosphorylated in AD and prevents apoptosis of confluent cells. Treatment of cortical neurons with ABetaÂ¸42 monomers increased Ser9 phosphorylation (inhibition) of the Akt substrate, GSK- 3ÃÆÃÂ¸ [97]. Inhibition of GSK-3ÃÆÃÂ¸ promotes cell survival through a variety of mechanisms including a reduced degradation of ÃÆÃÂ¸-catenin, which then translocates into the nucleus and activates the transcription of protective genes [126]."

Similarly specific stimulation of NMDA receptors promotes ABetaÂ¸ production and ABetaÂ¸ in turn depresses synaptic activity. Thus indirectly ABetaÂ¸ also plays a role in suppressing excessive glutamate release. Interestingly, ABetaÂ¸ may play an important role during synapse elimination and stimulatation of neurogenesis in the hippocampus during brain development [93].

In fact, overexpression of transgelin, a proposed AICD target gene, causes destabilization of actin filaments, depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim), and significant alteration of mitochondrial distribution and morphology in human SHEP neuroblastoma cells and primary neurons. These data demonstrate that induction of AICD/APP significantly alters cytoskeletal dynamics and mitochondrial function in neuronal cells by interacting with JIP1b or Fe65."

SET SupportingText = "Here, we present evidence that, besides APP expression regulation, miRNAs are equally involved in the regulation of neuronal APP mRNA alternative splicing. Lack of miRNAs in post-mitotic neurons in vivo is associated with APP exons 7 and 8 inclusion, while ectopic expression of miR-124, an abundant neuronal-specific miRNA, reversed these effects in cultured neurons. Similar results were obtained by depletion of endogenous polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1) in cells, a recognized miR-124 target gene. Furthermore, PTBP1 levels correlate with the presence of APP exons 7 and 8, while PTBP2 levels correlate with the skipping of these exons during neuronal differentiation. Finally, we show that miR-124 is down-regulated in AD brain. In sum, our results suggest that specific miRNAs are involved in the fine-tuning of APP alternative splicing in neurons. Since abnormal neuronal splicing of APP affects beta-amyloid peptide production, these results could contribute to the understanding of the implication of miRNAs in brain health and disease."

We now report that Vps10-domain proteins are candidate substrates for PKC and/or ROCK2 and act as phospho-state-sensitive physiological effectors for post-TGN sorting of APP and its derivatives. Activation of PKC resulted in increased shedding of the ectodomains of both APP and SorL1, and this was paralleled by an apparent increase in the level of the phosphorylated form of SorL1. ROCK2, the neuronal isoform of another protein kinase, was found to form complexes with SorL1, and both ROCK2 inhibition and ROCK2 knockdown enhanced generation of both soluble APP and ABetaÂ¸.These results highlight the potential importance of SorL1 in elucidating phospho-state sensitive mechanisms in the regulation of metabolism of APP and ABetaÂ¸ by PKC and ROCK2."

SET SupportingText = "Target gene repression mediated by miRNAs miR-181c and miR-9 both of which are down-regulated by amyloid-beta. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA regulators of protein synthesis that are essential for normal brain development and function. Their profiles are significantly altered in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) that is characterized by amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau deposition in brain. How deregulated miRNAs contribute to AD is not understood, as their dysfunction could be both a cause and a consequence of disease. To address this question we had previously profiled miRNAs in models of AD. This identified miR-9 and -181c as being down-regulated by Abeta in hippocampal cultures. Interestingly, there was a remarkable overlap with those miRNAs that are deregulated in Abeta-depositing APP23 transgenic mice and in human AD tissue. While the Abeta precursor protein APP itself is a target of miRNA regulation, the challenge resides in identifying further targets. Here, we expand the repertoire of miRNA target genes by identifying the 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) of TGFBI, TRIM2, SIRT1 and BTBD3 as being repressed by miR-9 and -181c, either alone or in combination. Taken together, our study identifies putative target genes of miRNAs miR-9 and 181c, which may function in brain homeostasis and disease pathogenesis."

The correlation of these markers with clinical parameters was also evaluated. The levels of p-tau were higher in AD compared to controls, while the tau/p-tau ratio was decreased. The expression of CCL2 was increased in AD. A positive correlation was observed between BA levels and all chemokines studied, and between CCL2 and p-tau levels.

Eighty-eight SNPs have been identified in the ApoE gene in which 31 are found to be nonsynonymous, 8 of them are coding synonymous, 33 are found to be in intron, and 3 are in untranslated region. The SNPs found in the untranslated region consisted of two SNPs from 5' and one SNP from the 3'. Twenty-nine percent of the identified nsSNPs have been reported as damaging. In the analysis of SNPs in the UTR regions, it has been recognized that rs72654467 from 5' and rs71673244 from 5' and 3' are responsible for the alteration in levels of expression. Both native and mutant protein structures were analyzed along with the stabilization residues.

SET SupportingText = "Abeta-Amyloid (Abeta) plaques in Alzheimer (AD) brains are surrounded by severe dendritic and axonal changes, including local spine loss, axonal swellings and distorted neurite trajectories. Whether and how plaques induce these neuropil abnormalities remains unknown. We tested the hypothesis that oligomeric assemblies of Abeta, seen in the periphery of plaques, mediate the neurodegenerative phenotype of AD by triggering activation of the enzyme GSK-3beta, which in turn appears to inhibit a transcriptional program mediated by CREB. We detect increased activity of GSK-3beta after exposure to oligomeric Abeta in neurons in culture, in the brain of double transgenic APP/tau mice and in AD brains. Activation of GSK-3beta, even in the absence of Abeta, is sufficient to produce a phenocopy of Abeta-induced dendritic spine loss in neurons in culture, while pharmacological inhibition of GSK-3beta prevents spine loss and increases expression of CREB-target genes like BDNF. Of note, in transgenic mice GSK-3beta inhibition ameliorated plaque-related neuritic changes and increased CREB-mediated gene expression. Moreover, GSK-3beta inhibition robustly decreased the oligomeric Abeta load in the mouse brain. All these findings support the idea that GSK3beta is aberrantly activated by the presence of Abeta, and contributes, at least in part, to the neuronal anatomical derangement associated with Abeta plaques in AD brains and to Abeta pathology itself."

SPT is a heterodimer composed of serine palmitoyltransferase long chain 1 (SPTLC1) and either serine palmitoyltransferase long chain 2 (SPTLC2) or serine palmitoyltransferase long chain 3 (SPTLC3) (Rotthier et al., 2010). In the brain, SPTLC3 is lowly expressed while SPTLC1 and SPTLC2 are the major subunits (Hornemann et al., 2006). However, the regulation of these subunits and in turn SPT is not well understood. Cell culture studies demonstrate that SPT activity increases in response to various stimuli (i.e. etoposide or resveratrol), but without concomitant changes in SPTLC1 and SPTLC2 mRNA levels, which have led researchers to hypothesize that SPT may be post-transcriptionally regulated."

In the present study, we show that Dyrk1A is activated under the condition of apoptotic cell death. In addition, Dyrk1A is coupled to JNK1 activation, and directly interacts with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1). Moreover, Dyrk1A positively regulates ASK1-mediated JNK1-signaling, and appears to directly phosphorylate ASK1.

Recently, many studies implicated a potential role of Dyrk1A during cell death. For example, Dyrk1A caused the formation of abnormal protein aggregates through the phosphorylation of a-synuclein, APP, and tau.

SET SupportingText = "Background and Objective: Could a normal - but persistent - stress response to impeded axonal transport lead to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD)? Our results offer an affirmative answer, suggesting a mechanism for the abnormal production of amyloid-beta (Abeta), triggered by the slowed axonal transport at old age. We hypothesize that Abeta precursor protein (APP) is a sensor at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that detects, and signals to the nucleus, abnormalities in axonal transport. When persistently activated, due to chronically slowed-down transport, this signaling pathway leads to accumulation of Abeta within the ER. Methods and Results: We tested this hypothesis with the neuronal cell line CAD. We show that, normally, a fraction of APP is transported into neurites by recruiting kinesin-1 via the adaptor protein, Fe65. Under conditions that block kinesin-1-dependent transport, APP, Fe65 and kinesin-1 accumulate in the soma, and form a complex at the ER.This complex recruits active c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which phosphorylates APP at Thr(668). This phosphorylation increases the cleavage of APP by the amyloidogenic pathway, which generates Abeta within the ER lumen, and releases Fe65 into the cytoplasm. Part of the released Fe65 translocates into the nucleus, likely to initiate a gene transcription response to arrested transport. Prolonged arrest of kinesin-1-dependent transport could thus lead to accumulation and oligomerization of Abeta in the ER. Conclusion: These results support a model where the APP:Fe65 complex is a sensor at the ER for detecting the increased level of kinesin-1 caused by halted transport, which signals to the nucleus, while concomitantly generating an oligomerization-prone pool of Abeta in the ER. Our hypothesis could thus explain a pathogenic mechanism in AD."

MiR-124 expression was steadily altered when its mimic and inhibitor were transfected in vitro. The results showed the expression of BACE1, one of the potential functional downstream targets of miR-124, was well correlated with cell death induced by Abeta neurotoxicity, and its expression level could be up- and down-regulated by suppression or over expression of miR-124 level respectively.

SET SupportingText = "Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of senile plaques of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP) and neurofibrillary tangles made of hyperphosphorylated Tau. Increasing APP gene dosage or expression has been shown to cause familial early-onset AD. However, whether and how protein stability of APP is regulated is unclear. The prolyl isomerase Pin1 and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) have been shown to have the opposite effects on APP processing and Tau hyperphosphorylation, relevant to the pathogenesis of AD. However, nothing is known about their relationship. In this study, we found that Pin1 binds to the pT330-P motif in GSK3beta to inhibit its kinase activity. Furthermore, Pin1 promotes protein turnover of APP by inhibiting GSK3beta activity. A point mutation either at Thr-330, the Pin1-binding site in GSK3beta, or at Thr-668, the GSK3beta phosphorylation site in APP, abolished the regulation of GSK3beta activity, Thr-668 phosphorylation, and APP stability by Pin1, resulting in reduced non-amyloidogenic APP processing and increased APP levels. These results uncover a novel role of Pin1 in inhibiting GSK3beta kinase activity to reduce APP protein levels, providing a previously unrecognized mechanism by which Pin1 protects against Alzheimer disease."

SET SupportingText = "Although there are numerous studies regarding Alzheimer's disease (AD), the cause and progression of AD are still not well understood. The researches in the past decade implicated amyloid-beta (Abeta) overproduction as a causative event in disease pathogenesis, but still failed to clarify the mechanism of pathology from Abeta production to central neural system defects in AD. The present review raises the hypothesis that the onset of AD pathology is closely related with mitochondrial dysfunction induced by Abeta and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) axonal transport deficits. It is well-known that axonal transport defect and attenuation of BDNF-neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase 2 (TrkB) signal are fatal to neuronal function and survival.We hypothesized that abnormal amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and Abeta production in mitochondria disturb the axonal transport by impairing mitochondrial function and attenuate BDNF-neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase 2 signal subsequently.For this hypothesis, the factors related with the initiation of AD pathology are not only limited to the neurons per se but also expanded to the microenvironment around neurons, such as the secretion of BDNF from astrocytes. The modification of the origin in this pathway may contribute to slow down the disease progression of AD."

SET SupportingText = "Mint adaptor proteins bind to the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and regulate APP processing associated with Alzheimer's disease; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying Mint regulation in APP binding and processing remain unclear. Biochemical, biophysical, and cellular experiments now show that the Mint1 phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain that binds to APP is intramolecularly inhibited by the adjacent C-terminal linker region. The crystal structure of a C-terminally extended Mint1 PTB fragment reveals that the linker region forms a short a-helix that folds back onto the PTB domain and sterically hinders APP binding. This intramolecular interaction is disrupted by mutation of Tyr633 within the Mint1 autoinhibitory helix leading to enhanced APP binding and Abeta-amyloid production. Our findings suggest that an autoinhibitory mechanism in Mint1 is important for regulating APP processing and may provide novel therapies for Alzheimer's disease."

SET SupportingText = "AMPK activity decreases in AD brain, indicating decreased mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Emerging evidence demonstrates that AMPK activation is a potential target for improving perturbed brain energy metabolism that is involved in the pathogenesis of AD. The roles of AMPK in the pathogenesis of AD include Abeta-amyloid protein (Abeta) generation and tau phosphorylation. In particular, AMPK may regulate Abeta generation through modulating neuronal cholesterol and sphingomyelin levels and through regulating APP distribution in the lipid rafts. AMPK is activated by phosphorylation of Thr-172 by LKB1 complex in response to increase in the AMP/ATP ratio and by calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-beta in response to elevated Ca(2+) levels, which contributes to regulating Abeta generation. AMPK is a physiological tau kinase and can increase the phosphorylation of tau at Ser-262. AMPK can also directly phosphorylate tau at Thr-231 and Ser-396/404. Furthermore, AMPK activation decreases mTOR signaling activity to facilitate autophagy and promotes lysosomal degradation of Abeta. However, AMPK activation has non-neuroprotective property and may lead to detrimental outcomes, including Abeta generation and tau phosphorylation. Therefore, it is still unclear whether AMPK could serve a potential therapeutic target for AD, and hence, further studies will be needed to clarify the role of AMPK in AD."

Thus, perturbation to axonal transport of APP on calsyntenin-1 containing carriers induces alterations to APP processing that increase production of ABetaÂ¸.

Altered calcium signaling differentially regulates genes such as calcineurin, calmodulin kinase II, MAP kinase etc and induces protein modifications and neurite degeneration. Since functional synapses and synaptic transmission are fundamental processes in memory formation, alterations in these processes can lead to neuronal dysfunction and memory deficit as seen in Alzheimer's disease. This chapter gives an overview of calcium signaling in different systems, specifically neurons, the functioning of pre- and post-synaptic signaling, and how their deregulation influences pathology development in Alzheimer's disease."

SET SupportingText = "The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a large, ubiquitous integral membrane protein with a small amyloid-beta (Abeta) domain. In the human brain, endosomal processing of APP produces neurotoxic Abeta-peptides, which are involved in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we show that the Abeta sequence exerts a physiological function when still present in the unprocessed APP molecule. From the extracellular site, Abeta concentrates APP molecules into plasmalemmal membrane protein clusters. Moreover, Abeta stabilization of clusters is a prerequisite for their targeting to endocytic clathrin structures. Therefore, we conclude that the Abeta domain directly mediates a central step in APP trafficking, driving its own conversion into neurotoxic peptides."

SET SupportingText = "In particular,in receptor TK, tyrosine residue can be phosphorylated to generate the NPXpY motif, which represents a docking sitefor several intracellular adaptor proteins through the phosphortyrosine-binding domain (PTB). Similarly, the adaptor proteins Shc and Grb2 can bind AbetaPP (or its CTFs) in the presence of phosphorylated tyrosine in this motif. However, AbetaPP (or its CTFs) and the AbetaPP-related proteins, APLP1 and APLP2, can also interact with several other signalling proteins, including X11, Fe65, mDab, c-Abl, JIP-1, and Numb, independently of the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue within the YENPTY motif. From a functional point of view, the interaction between the neuron-specific adaptor protein Fe65 and AbetaPP via the second PTB domain of Fe65 was shown to modulate AbetaPP processing, favoring the generation of Abeta and AbetaPP trafficking, in several cell lines. Another adaptor that binds to AbetaPP is mDAB. It is a protein related to the Reelin subgraph and interacting with YENPTY motif through a PTB domain. mDAB is active during embryogenesis, where it regulates the position of neurons in the brain laminar structure, and mDAB binding increases the amounts of mature AbetaPP and Abeta formation. On the contrary, X11 stabilizes AbetaPP conformation in membrane, inhibiting Abeta secretion in cultured cells, likely impairing AbetaPP trafficking to sites containing active gamma-secretase complexes. JIP's are member of JNK-scaffolding family proteins kinases, implicated in different signal pathway, including neuronal apoptotic process. JNK-interacting proteins JIP1b and JIP2 bind to the cytoplasmic tail of AbetaPP. The expression of JIP1b stabilizes immature AbetaPP and decreases the AbetaPP ectodomain, Abeta40/Abeta42 and CTFs abundance.All these observations suggest that some of these protein-protein interactions may play a role in the modulation of the amyloidogenic pathway and thus might have a role in neurodegeneration."

Subsequently, a novel interaction between reelin and AbetaPP was discovered, leading to increase in the cell surface levels of AbetaPP and affecting AbetaPP processing and Abeta production. It was shown that reelin signaling in excitatory synapses can restore normal synaptic plasticity, which is impaired by oligomeric Abeta peptides at concentrations within the range detectable in the brains of AD patients. At high concentrations of Abeta peptides, reelin can no longer overcome the Abeta-induced functional suppression, and this condition coincides with a complete blockade of the reelin-dependent phosphorylation of NR2 subunits in NMDA receptors. This reversal requires the LRP receptor-dependent activation of tyrosine kinases of the Src family."

SET SupportingText = "Amyloid precursor protein (APP) mutations associated with familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) usually lead to increases in amyloid Abeta-protein (Abeta) levels or aggregation. Here, we identified a novel APP mutation, located within the Abeta sequence (Abeta(D7H)), in a Taiwanese family with early onset AD and explored the pathogenicity of this mutation. Cellular and biochemical analysis reveal that this mutation increased Abeta production, Abeta42/40 ratio and prolonged Abeta42 oligomer state with higher neurotoxicity. Because the D7H mutant Abeta has an additional metal ion-coordinating residue, histidine, we speculate that this mutation may promote susceptibility of Abeta to ion. When co-incubated with Zn(2+) or Cu(2+), Abeta(D7H) aggregated into low molecular weight oligomers. Together, the D7H mutation could contribute to AD pathology through a double punch effect on elevating both Abeta production and oligomerization. Although the pathogenic nature of this mutation needs further confirmation, our findings suggest that the Abeta N-terminal region potentially modulates APP processing and Abeta aggregation, and further provides a genetic indication of the importance of Zn(2+) and Cu(2+) in the etiology of AD.Our result indicates that the D7H mutation promotes Abeta40 interaction with Zn2+ and Cu2+, where the Abeta interaction with Zn2+ is especially enhanced by the mutation"

Because of the challenges of obtaining such large cohorts, we describe here a novel sequential strategy that combines pooling of DNA and bootstrapping (pbGWAS) in order to significantly increase the statistical power and exponentially reduce expenses. We applied this method to a very homogeneous sample of patients belonging to a unique and clinically well-characterized multigenerational pedigree with one of the most severe forms of early onset AD, carrying the PSEN1 p.Glu280Ala mutation (often referred to as E280A mutation), which originated as a consequence of a founder effect. In this cohort, we identified novel loci genome-wide significantly associated as modifiers of the age of onset of AD (CD44, rs187116, P=1.29 x 10(-12); NPHP1, rs10173717, P=1.74 â 10(-12); CADPS2, rs3757536, P=1.54 x 10(-10); GREM2, rs12129547, P=1.69 x 10(-13), among others) as well as other loci known to be associated with AD."

They are functionally linked by Fe65, a PTB (phosphotyrosine-binding)-domain-containing adaptor protein that binds to intracellular NPxY-motifs of APP and LRP1, thereby influencing expression levels, cellular trafficking and processing. Additionally, Fe65 has been reported to mediate nuclear signalling in combination with intracellular domains of APP and LRP1. We have previously identified another adaptor protein, GULP1 (engulfment adaptor PTB-domain-containing 1). In the present study we characterize and compare nuclear trafficking and transactivation of GULP1 and Fe65 together with APP and LRP1 and report differential nuclear trafficking of adaptors when APP or LRP1 are co-expressed. The observed effects were additionally supported by a reporter-plasmid-based transactivation assay. The results from the present study indicate that Fe65 might have signalling properties together with APP and LRP1, whereas GULP1 only mediates LRP1 transactivation."

SET SupportingText = " In this issue of Nature Medicine, Thathiah et al.4 now provide provocative evidence that the adaptor protein beta mediates the Abeta-altering effects of these GPCRs by promoting Abeta generation. This newly uncovered function of beta-arrestin 2 suggests it could be targeted to decrease amyloid pathology in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Production of the amyloid-beta peptide in Alzheimer's disease by the gamma-secretase complex can be regulated by certain G protein coupled receptors. This regulation seems to be mediated by beta-arrestin-2, whose expression was found to be elevated in Alzheimer's disease brains.Recruitment of beta-arrestin 2 to a GPCR leads to interaction with the gamma-secretase complex via the Aph-1 subunit. Other members of the complex include presenilin-1 (PS-1), nicastrin (Nct) and Pen-2. The complex then moves laterally into lipid rafts, where gamma-secretase activation is enhanced. Internalization may also occur to localize gamma-secretase to late endosomes, where its activation is also increased. Cleavage of APP by beta-secretase (BACE1) to release soluble APP (sAPPb) followed by gamma-secretase produces Abeta and APP intracellular domain (AICD). Increased production and secretion of Abeta from cells can lead to extracellular Abeta aggregation in the form of plaques. Mutagenesis of GPR3 in regions of the protein that specifically interact with either G protein or beta-arrestin 2 further showed that beta-arrestin 2, not G protein, mediates the ability of GPR3 to increase Abeta levels."

SET SupportingText = "Amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) accumulating in the brain of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients is believed to be the main pathophysiologcal cause of the disease. Proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein by alpha-secretase ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10) protects the brain from the production of the Abeta. Meanwhile, dysregulation or aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been widely documented in AD patients. In this study, we demonstrated that overexpression of miR-144, which was previously reported to be increased in elderly primate brains and AD patients, significantly decreased activity of the luciferase reporter containing the ADAM10 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) and suppressed the ADAM10 protein level, whereas the miR-144 inhibitor led to an increase of the luciferase activity. The negative regulation caused by miR-144 was strictly dependent on the binding of the miRNA to its recognition element in the ADAM10 3'-UTR. Moreover, we also showed that activator protein-1 regulates the transcription of miR-144 and the up-regulation of miR-144 at least partially induces the suppression of the ADAM10 protein in the presence of Abeta. In addition, we found that miR-451, a miRNA processed from a single gene locus with miR-144, is also involved in the regulation of ADAM10 expression. Taken together, our data therefore demonstrate miR-144/451 is a negative regulator of the ADAM10 protein and suggest a mechanistic role for miR-144/451 in AD pathogenesis."

SET SupportingText = "We have previously reported that CysLT1R activation is involved in Abeta generation. In this study, we investigated rescuing effect of CysLT1R antagonist montelukast on Abeta1-42-induced neurotoxicity in primary neurons. Our data showed that Abeta1-42 elicited a marked increase of CysLT1R expression in primary mouse neurons. This increment of CysLT1R expression was accompanied by increases of inflammatory factors such as NF-ÃÂºB p65, tumor necrosis factor-ÃÂ± (TNFÃÂ±) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) as well as pro-apoptotic protein Caspase-3 activation and anti-apoptotic process protein Bcl-2 reduction. This observation was confirmed with treatment of montelukast, a selective CysLT1R antagonist, which had significant effect on Abeta1-42-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, blockade of CysLT1R with montelukast reversed Abeta1-42-mediated increase of CysLT1R expression, and concomitant changes of the pro-inflammatory factors and the apoptotic process-related proteins. The results demonstrate that montelukast rescued neurons against Abeta1-42-induced neurotoxicity, neuroinflammation and apoptosis by down-regulating CysLT1R-mediated NF-ÃÂºB signaling, suggesting that CysLT1R may be a potential target for AD, and its antagonist may have beneficial effects for treatment of AD."
