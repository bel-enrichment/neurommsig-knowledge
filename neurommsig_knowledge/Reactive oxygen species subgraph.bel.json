and morphological alterations of mitochondria may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Particularly, mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of amyloid-beta-induced neuronal toxicity in Alzheimer's disease. The recent emphasis on the intracellular biology of amyloid-beta and its precursor protein (APP) has led researchers to consider the possibility that mitochondria-associated and mitochondrial amyloid-beta may directly cause neurotoxicity. Both proteins are known to localize to mitochondrial membranes, block the transport of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins to mitochondria, interact with mitochondrial proteins, disrupt the electron transport chain, increase reactive oxygen species production, cause mitochondrial damage, and prevent neurons from functioning normally.

Phosphorylation of GSK-3 and BAD inactivates these proteins and thereby inhibits further signaling leading to apoptosis.

In conclusion, i.c.v. administration of riluzole attenuated morphine-induced tolerance to analgesia and apoptosis in addition to preventing the morphine-induced increase of glutamate in the lumbar spinal cord of rats. In addition to being an anti-glutamatergic agent, riluzole also has antioxidant effects and can protect dopaminergic neurons against oxidative stress by reducing lipid peroxidation and ATP consumption [19, 27, 35, 36]. On the other hand, our results show that 80 ÃÂµg/10 ÃÂµl of riluzole increases the level of Bcl-2 in the lumbar spinal cord when administered with morphine", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "reference": "20885006"}, "annotations": {"Species": {"10116": true}, "Subgraph": {"Reactive oxygen species subgraph": true}, "Confidence": {"High": true}}, "source": 17, "target": 57, "key": "9a096e50db1d82a9170c1fe497fdf08f987ef969b72423451f66dddb043f66f17b5193a011d452d637aebcd43a86a97a59c59a094795a8874b9f31c254f55531"}, {"line": 28831, "relation": "decreases", "evidence": "These findings show that riluzole maintains altered oxidant-antioxidant balance.
