Activation of the neuronal pentameric nAChRs is involved in diverse brain functions including synaptic plasticity and memory [237, 238] and enhances transmitter release in several brain regions including the hippocampus [239], the spinal cord dorsal horn [240], the olfactory bulb, and the amygdala [241]. The increase of synaptic plasticity by ABetaÂ¸ requires activation of nAChRs [242]. Because activation of nAChRs is necessary for the ABetaÂ¸-induced increase of synaptic plasticity and memory under normal conditions, ABetaÂ¸ may modify glutamate release with a mechanism dependent upon activation of nAChRs [83]. However, several reports of the effect of ABetaÂ¸42 on nAChRs are conflicting. Some studies have reported that ABetaÂ¸42 activates nAChRs [243, 244], while others indicate that ABetaÂ¸42 inhibits nAChRs [245, 246]. Interestingly, picomolar concentrations of ABetaÂ¸42 were effective in activating nAChRs while higher levels of ABetaÂ¸ produced inhibitory action. The disparity may depend on the nanomolar ABetaÂ¸1ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢â¬Å42 inhibition of nicotine-induced Ca2+ responses while picomolar ABetaÂ¸42 directly evokes sustained increases in presynaptic Ca2+ via nAChRs [244]. ABetaÂ¸42 binds to the nAChR with picomolar affinity [247]. This binding can modulate presynaptic, glutamate-mediated synaptic transmission or glutamate release, suggesting that ABetaÂ¸42-dependent cholinergic modulation activates signal transduction mechanisms that ultimately result in synaptic transmission and memory consolidation [248]. However, it remains to be determined whether these effects are mediated by a direct physical interaction of the ABetaÂ¸ peptide with the nAChRs. Immunohistochemical studies on human sporadic AD brains show that ABetaÂ¸42 and nAChR, are both present in neuritic plaques and co-localize in individual cortical neurons suggesting that ABetaÂ¸ could be tightly associated with nAChR [247]. Alternatively, ABetaÂ¸ might be responsible for regulation of nAChR function through strong binding with membrane lipids [249]. Picomolar or higher ABetaÂ¸42 acting through nAChRs, can elicit ERK MAPK activation in hippocampal cultures [245, 250] possibly triggered by Ca2+ influx [243, 251]. ERK is known to regulate transcription factors such as CREB and Elk-1 by phosphorylation [140], which help initiate transcription of memory-associated genes that contain their respective regulatory elements [252].

Interestingly, picomolar concentrations of ABetaÂ¸42 were effective in activating nAChRs while higher levels of ABetaÂ¸ produced inhibitory action. The disparity may depend on the nanomolar ABetaÂ¸1ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢â¬Å42 inhibition of nicotine-induced Ca2+ responses while picomolar ABetaÂ¸42 directly evokes sustained increases in presynaptic Ca2+ via nAChRs [244]. ABetaÂ¸42 binds to the nAChR with picomolar affinity [247]. This binding can modulate presynaptic, glutamate-mediated synaptic transmission or glutamate release, suggesting that ABetaÂ¸42-dependent cholinergic modulation activates signal transduction mechanisms that ultimately result in synaptic transmission and memory consolidation [248]. However, it remains to be determined whether these effects are mediated by a direct physical interaction of the ABetaÂ¸ peptide with the nAChRs. Immunohistochemical studies on human sporadic AD brains show that ABetaÂ¸42 and nAChR, are both present in neuritic plaques and co-localize in individual cortical neurons suggesting that ABetaÂ¸ could be tightly associated with nAChR [247]. Alternatively, ABetaÂ¸ might be responsible for regulation of nAChR function through strong binding with membrane lipids [249]. Picomolar or higher ABetaÂ¸42 acting through nAChRs, can elicit ERK MAPK activation in hippocampal cultures [245, 250] possibly triggered by Ca2+ influx [243, 251]. ERK is known to regulate transcription factors such as CREB and Elk-1 by phosphorylation [140], which help initiate transcription of memory-associated genes that contain their respective regulatory elements [252]. Therefore, over-activation of nAChRs and excessive Ca2+ influx or dysregulation of Ca2+ homeostasis provide a molecular mechanism for the cholinergic dysfunction that is a hallmark of AD [253, 254].", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "reference": "20847424"}, "annotations": {"Subgraph": {"Acetylcholine signaling subgraph": true}, "Confidence": {"High": true}}, "source": 105, "target": 45, "key": "c81dddaf32c91edf65ea5ec78ee544366703ef60f943928e98682c092ab1879b67f03fb458758b8ef6ddabfb5247d0da8d5dfbac9716d435c83c05ed91997489"}, {"line": 47043, "relation": "positiveCorrelation", "evidence": "Inflammatory components related to AD neuroinflammation include brain cells such as microglia and astrocytes, the classic and alternate pathways of the complement system, the pentraxin acute-phase proteins, neuronal-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), peroxisomal proliferators-activated receptors (PPARs), as well as cytokines and chemokines.

The increase of synaptic plasticity by ABetaÂ¸ requires activation of nAChRs [242]. Because activation of nAChRs is necessary for the ABetaÂ¸-induced increase of synaptic plasticity and memory under normal conditions, ABetaÂ¸ may modify glutamate release with a mechanism dependent upon activation of nAChRs [83]. However, several reports of the effect of ABetaÂ¸42 on nAChRs are conflicting. Some studies have reported that ABetaÂ¸42 activates nAChRs [243, 244], while others indicate that ABetaÂ¸42 inhibits nAChRs [245, 246]. Interestingly, picomolar concentrations of ABetaÂ¸42 were effective in activating nAChRs while higher levels of ABetaÂ¸ produced inhibitory action.

Immunohistochemical studies on human sporadic AD brains show that ABetaÂ¸42 and nAChR, are both present in neuritic plaques and co-localize in individual cortical neurons suggesting that ABetaÂ¸ could be tightly associated with nAChR [247].

Activation of the neuronal pentameric nAChRs is involved in diverse brain functions including synaptic plasticity and memory [237, 238] and enhances transmitter release in several brain regions including the hippocampus [239], the spinal cord dorsal horn [240], the olfactory bulb, and the amygdala [241]. The increase of synaptic plasticity by ABetaÂ¸ requires activation of nAChRs [242]. Because activation of nAChRs is necessary for the ABetaÂ¸-induced increase of synaptic plasticity and memory under normal conditions, ABetaÂ¸ may modify glutamate release with a mechanism dependent upon activation of nAChRs [83]. However, several reports of the effect of ABetaÂ¸42 on nAChRs are conflicting. Some studies have reported that ABetaÂ¸42 activates nAChRs [243, 244], while others indicate that ABetaÂ¸42 inhibits nAChRs [245, 246]. Interestingly, picomolar concentrations of ABetaÂ¸42 were effective in activating nAChRs while higher levels of ABetaÂ¸ produced inhibitory action. The disparity may depend on the nanomolar ABetaÂ¸1ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢â¬Å42 inhibition of nicotine-induced Ca2+ responses while picomolar ABetaÂ¸42 directly evokes sustained increases in presynaptic Ca2+ via nAChRs [244]. ABetaÂ¸42 binds to the nAChR with picomolar affinity [247]. This binding can modulate presynaptic, glutamate-mediated synaptic transmission or glutamate release, suggesting that ABetaÂ¸42-dependent cholinergic modulation activates signal transduction mechanisms that ultimately result in synaptic transmission and memory consolidation [248]. However, it remains to be determined whether these effects are mediated by a direct physical interaction of the ABetaÂ¸ peptide with the nAChRs. Immunohistochemical studies on human sporadic AD brains show that ABetaÂ¸42 and nAChR, are both present in neuritic plaques and co-localize in individual cortical neurons suggesting that ABetaÂ¸ could be tightly associated with nAChR [247]. Alternatively, ABetaÂ¸ might be responsible for regulation of nAChR function through strong binding with membrane lipids [249]. Picomolar or higher ABetaÂ¸42 acting through nAChRs, can elicit ERK MAPK activation in hippocampal cultures [245, 250] possibly triggered by Ca2+ influx [243, 251].

Activation of the neuronal pentameric nAChRs is involved in diverse brain functions including synaptic plasticity and memory [237, 238] and enhances transmitter release in several brain regions including the hippocampus [239], the spinal cord dorsal horn [240], the olfactory bulb, and the amygdala [241]. The increase of synaptic plasticity by ABetaÂ¸ requires activation of nAChRs [242]. Because activation of nAChRs is necessary for the ABetaÂ¸-induced increase of synaptic plasticity and memory under normal conditions, ABetaÂ¸ may modify glutamate release with a mechanism dependent upon activation of nAChRs [83]. However, several reports of the effect of ABetaÂ¸42 on nAChRs are conflicting. Some studies have reported that ABetaÂ¸42 activates nAChRs [243, 244], while others indicate that ABetaÂ¸42 inhibits nAChRs [245, 246]. Interestingly, picomolar concentrations of ABetaÂ¸42 were effective in activating nAChRs while higher levels of ABetaÂ¸ produced inhibitory action. The disparity may depend on the nanomolar ABetaÂ¸1ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢â¬Å42 inhibition of nicotine-induced Ca2+ responses while picomolar ABetaÂ¸42 directly evokes sustained increases in presynaptic Ca2+ via nAChRs [244]. ABetaÂ¸42 binds to the nAChR with picomolar affinity [247]. This binding can modulate presynaptic, glutamate-mediated synaptic transmission or glutamate release, suggesting that ABetaÂ¸42-dependent cholinergic modulation activates signal transduction mechanisms that ultimately result in synaptic transmission and memory consolidation [248]. However, it remains to be determined whether these effects are mediated by a direct physical interaction of the ABetaÂ¸ peptide with the nAChRs. Immunohistochemical studies on human sporadic AD brains show that ABetaÂ¸42 and nAChR, are both present in neuritic plaques and co-localize in individual cortical neurons suggesting that ABetaÂ¸ could be tightly associated with nAChR [247]. Alternatively, ABetaÂ¸ might be responsible for regulation of nAChR function through strong binding with membrane lipids [249]. Picomolar or higher ABetaÂ¸42 acting through nAChRs, can elicit ERK MAPK activation in hippocampal cultures [245, 250] possibly triggered by Ca2+ influx [243, 251]. ERK is known to regulate transcription factors such as CREB and Elk-1 by phosphorylation [140], which help initiate transcription of memory-associated genes that contain their respective regulatory elements [252]. Therefore, over-activation of nAChRs and excessive Ca2+ influx or dysregulation of Ca2+ homeostasis provide a molecular mechanism for the cholinergic dysfunction that is a hallmark of AD [253, 254].", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "reference": "20847424"}, "annotations": {"Subgraph": {"Acetylcholine signaling subgraph": true}, "Confidence": {"High": true}}, "source": 107, "target": 45, "key": "440b6c535982f4febd8ba219dfd626506673d5987631c1cb73084f84056f98ceba32349e3477a1fbd3e20126cdd2e5246c68218fde7db67e2eccc1be0c814ec3"}, {"line": 18182, "relation": "increases", "evidence": "Galantamine and nefiracetam have been shown to potentiate the phasic activity of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRss) in the brain.
