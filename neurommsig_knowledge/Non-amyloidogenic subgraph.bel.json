Our results offer an affirmative answer, suggesting a mechanism for the abnormal production of amyloid-beta (Abeta), triggered by the slowed axonal transport at old age. We hypothesize that Abeta precursor protein (APP) is a sensor at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that detects, and signals to the nucleus, abnormalities in axonal transport. When persistently activated, due to chronically slowed-down transport, this signaling pathway leads to accumulation of Abeta within the ER. Methods and Results: We tested this hypothesis with the neuronal cell line CAD. We show that, normally, a fraction of APP is transported into neurites by recruiting kinesin-1 via the adaptor protein, Fe65. Under conditions that block kinesin-1-dependent transport, APP, Fe65 and kinesin-1 accumulate in the soma, and form a complex at the ER. This complex recruits active c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which phosphorylates APP at Thr(668). This phosphorylation increases the cleavage of APP by the amyloidogenic pathway, which generates Abeta within the ER lumen, and releases Fe65 into the cytoplasm. Part of the released Fe65 translocates into the nucleus, likely to initiate a gene transcription response to arrested transport. Prolonged arrest of kinesin-1-dependent transport could thus lead to accumulation and oligomerization of Abeta in the ER. Conclusion: These results support a model where the APP:Fe65 complex is a sensor at the ER for detecting the increased level of kinesin-1 caused by halted transport, which signals to the nucleus, while concomitantly generating an oligomerization-prone pool of Abeta in the ER. Our hypothesis could thus explain a pathogenic mechanism in AD.", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "reference": "22156573"}, "annotations": {"Disease": {"Alzheimer's disease": true}, "Subgraph": {"Non-amyloidogenic subgraph": true}, "Confidence": {"High": true}}, "subject": {"modifier": "Translocation"}, "source": 185, "target": 187, "key": "e073c8f47ae73ac746c89f406de09ba0e50799750af497e2f6d7fdff2f00ac1d3ac16e437b2a34d914b8554689ef7d949307a5ea4bcb57d774d0a5b45cb750bb"}, {"line": 248, "relation": "association", "evidence": "Calsyntenin-1 is a ligand for kinesin-1 light chains and APP is transported through axons on kinesin-1 molecular motors.

Subsequently, it was demonstrated that seladin-1 has also enzymatic activity [3-beta-hydroxysterol delta-24-reductase, (DHCR24)], which catalyzes the synthesis of cholesterol from desmosterol. The amount of membrane cholesterol may play an important role both in protecting neuronal cells against toxic insults and in inhibiting the production of beta-amyloid. We demonstrated that seladin-1 overexpression increases the amount of membrane cholesterol and induces resistance against beta-amyloid aggregates in neuroblastoma cells, whereas a specific inhibitor of DHCR24 increased cell vulnerability. We also hypothesized that seladin-1 might be a mediator of the neuroprotective effects of estrogens. We first demonstrated that, in human fetal neuroepithelial cells (FNC), 17beta-estradiol, raloxifene, and tamoxifen exert protective effects against beta-amyloid toxicity and oxidative stress. In addition, these molecules significantly increased the expression of seladin-1 and the amount of cell cholesterol. Then, we showed that, upon seladin-1 silencing, the protective effects of estrogens were abolished, thus indicating this factor as a fundamental mediator of estrogen-mediated neuroprotection, at least in FNC cells. Furthermore, we detected the presence of functionally active half-palindromic estrogen responsive elements upstream the coding region of the seladin-1 gene.

One of the physiological functions of ABetaÂ¸ has been suggested to control cholesterol transport [167]. Prevalence of AD is reduced among people treated with inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis, statins [168, 169] and animal studies support these results [170]. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that cholesterol modulates APP processing and affects APP mRNA expression [171]. Another mechanism is the increased binding of ABetaÂ¸ to ApoE4 over non-E4 alleles. ApoE is a lipid and cholesterol transport protein responsible for the efflux of cholesterol from neurons to form stable complexes both in vitro and in vivo [172]. Allele ApoE4 is a major risk factor in AD [173]. This relationship might promote synaptogenesis, since in vitro studies have demonstrated that cholesterol released by astroglia increases synaptogenesis [174, 175] with resulting modulation of spike rates [176].

Prevalence of AD is reduced among people treated with inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis, statins [168, 169] and animal studies support these results [170]. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that cholesterol modulates APP processing and affects APP mRNA expression [171]. Another mechanism is the increased binding of ABetaÂ¸ to ApoE4 over non-E4 alleles. ApoE is a lipid and cholesterol transport protein responsible for the efflux of cholesterol from neurons to form stable complexes both in vitro and in vivo [172]. Allele ApoE4 is a major risk factor in AD [173]. This relationship might promote synaptogenesis, since in vitro studies have demonstrated that cholesterol released by astroglia increases synaptogenesis [174, 175] with resulting modulation of spike rates [176].

This motif and the flanking region serve as the binding site for many cytosolic adaptors with phosphotyrosine-binding domains, including Fe65, Fe65L1, Fe65L2, Mint1 (also called X11a), Mint2, Mint3, Dab1, and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase)-interacting protein family members. Interestingly, Fe65 acts as a functional linker between APP and LRP (another type I membrane protein containing two NPXY endocytosis motifs) in modulating endocytic APP trafficking and ABetaÂ¸ production. A conformational change introduced by phosphorylation at Thr668 (14 amino acids proximal to the YENPTY motif) interferes with Fe65 binding to APP and facilitates BACE1 and gamma-secretase cleavage of APP. Moreover, Fe65 stabilizes the highly labile AICD, which may serve as a regulatory step in modulating the physiological function of AICD (see below). In addition to APP, Mint proteins can directly bind ADP-ribosylation factors; thus, Mint proteins can potentially regulate vesicular trafficking of APP by serving as coat proteins. Finally, the type I transmembrane protein SorLA/LR11 (a member of the VPS10p domain receptor family), which functionally interacts with cytosolic adaptors GGA and PACS-1, attenuates ABetaÂ¸ production by acting as a Golgi/TGN retention factor. SorLA/LR11 is also genetically associated with AD, thus further implicating this sorting molecule in APP biology", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "name": "J Biol Chem. 2008 Oct 31;283(44):29615-9.

We found that under physiological conditions IDE is secreted at high levels from the microglial cells, and degrades Abeta extracellularly [73]. Purified IDE from rat liver and brain was shown to degrade Abeta effectively. IDE is present in the soluble fractions from human brains, and binds and degrades Abeta specifically [57] and [71].

IDE from brain homogenates degrades different forms of Abeta: Abeta40, Abeta42 and an Abeta mutant in one type of AD (Dutch Variant 1-40 Q) [61] and [71].

Our results offer an affirmative answer, suggesting a mechanism for the abnormal production of amyloid-beta (Abeta), triggered by the slowed axonal transport at old age. We hypothesize that Abeta precursor protein (APP) is a sensor at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that detects, and signals to the nucleus, abnormalities in axonal transport. When persistently activated, due to chronically slowed-down transport, this signaling pathway leads to accumulation of Abeta within the ER. Methods and Results: We tested this hypothesis with the neuronal cell line CAD. We show that, normally, a fraction of APP is transported into neurites by recruiting kinesin-1 via the adaptor protein, Fe65. Under conditions that block kinesin-1-dependent transport, APP, Fe65 and kinesin-1 accumulate in the soma, and form a complex at the ER. This complex recruits active c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which phosphorylates APP at Thr(668). This phosphorylation increases the cleavage of APP by the amyloidogenic pathway, which generates Abeta within the ER lumen, and releases Fe65 into the cytoplasm. Part of the released Fe65 translocates into the nucleus, likely to initiate a gene transcription response to arrested transport. Prolonged arrest of kinesin-1-dependent transport could thus lead to accumulation and oligomerization of Abeta in the ER. Conclusion: These results support a model where the APP:Fe65 complex is a sensor at the ER for detecting the increased level of kinesin-1 caused by halted transport, which signals to the nucleus, while concomitantly generating an oligomerization-prone pool of Abeta in the ER. Our hypothesis could thus explain a pathogenic mechanism in AD.", "citation": {"type": "PubMed", "reference": "22156573"}, "annotations": {"Disease": {"Alzheimer's disease": true}, "Subgraph": {"Non-amyloidogenic subgraph": true}, "Confidence": {"High": true}}, "subject": {"modifier": "Activity", "effect": {"name": "tport", "namespace": "bel"}}, "object": {"modifier": "Translocation"}, "source": 115, "target": 185, "key": "4362fe2dfc805f3681c895eca943993a31b4ad8a5cc75e2ff2020e98fae163ef08c1cb999d3bee747070d1089558de78e3c7fc6bd7409a580c481135d85c87f5"}, {"line": 38779, "relation": "increases", "evidence": "This processing is activated through a pathway involving the PDGF receptor, Src, and Rac1.

Neuroprotection may result through modulation of Wnt signaling since an increase in beta-catenin and inhibition of GSK-3beta is observed upon exposure to rosiglitazone [Inestrosa et al., 2005], although a different study has shown that activation of PPARgamma by a potent ligand leads to beta-catenin degradation [Liu and Farmer 2004]. Nonetheless, in support of the role for PPARgamma activation in neuroprotection, PPARgamma agonists have potent anti-inflammatory effects [Luna-Medina et al., 2005], inhibit microglial activation [Bernardo et al., 2005; Heneka et al., 2005] and have been shown to improve verbal memory in AD patients with T2DM, possibly in a mechanism dependent on PPARgamma activation . A recent report demonstrates that overexpression of PPARgamma in cultured cells leads to a dramatic decrease in the production of Abeta, by increasing the rate of APP degradation via ubiquitination [D'Abramo et al., 2005].

This motif and the flanking region serve as the binding site for many cytosolic adaptors with phosphotyrosine-binding domains, including Fe65, Fe65L1, Fe65L2, Mint1 (also called X11a), Mint2, Mint3, Dab1, and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase)-interacting protein family members. Interestingly, Fe65 acts as a functional linker between APP and LRP (another type I membrane protein containing two NPXY endocytosis motifs) in modulating endocytic APP trafficking and ABetaÂ¸ production. A conformational change introduced by phosphorylation at Thr668 (14 amino acids proximal to the YENPTY motif) interferes with Fe65 binding to APP and facilitates BACE1 and gamma-secretase cleavage of APP. Moreover, Fe65 stabilizes the highly labile AICD, which may serve as a regulatory step in modulating the physiological function of AICD (see below). In addition to APP, Mint proteins can directly bind ADP-ribosylation factors; thus, Mint proteins can potentially regulate vesicular trafficking of APP by serving as coat proteins. Finally, the type I transmembrane protein SorLA/LR11 (a member of the VPS10p domain receptor family), which functionally interacts with cytosolic adaptors GGA and PACS-1, attenuates ABetaÂ¸ production by acting as a Golgi/TGN retention factor.

Subsequently, it was demonstrated that seladin-1 has also enzymatic activity [3-beta-hydroxysterol delta-24-reductase, (DHCR24)], which catalyzes the synthesis of cholesterol from desmosterol. The amount of membrane cholesterol may play an important role both in protecting neuronal cells against toxic insults and in inhibiting the production of beta-amyloid. We demonstrated that seladin-1 overexpression increases the amount of membrane cholesterol and induces resistance against beta-amyloid aggregates in neuroblastoma cells, whereas a specific inhibitor of DHCR24 increased cell vulnerability. We also hypothesized that seladin-1 might be a mediator of the neuroprotective effects of estrogens. We first demonstrated that, in human fetal neuroepithelial cells (FNC), 17beta-estradiol, raloxifene, and tamoxifen exert protective effects against beta-amyloid toxicity and oxidative stress. In addition, these molecules significantly increased the expression of seladin-1 and the amount of cell cholesterol. Then, we showed that, upon seladin-1 silencing, the protective effects of estrogens were abolished, thus indicating this factor as a fundamental mediator of estrogen-mediated neuroprotection, at least in FNC cells. Furthermore, we detected the presence of functionally active half-palindromic estrogen responsive elements upstream the coding region of the seladin-1 gene.
